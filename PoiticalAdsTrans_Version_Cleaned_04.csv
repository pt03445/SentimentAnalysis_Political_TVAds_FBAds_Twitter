By making big corporations and those at the top finally pay their fair share in taxes. And those companies that move overseas? She'd charge them an exit tax.

0,"We remember what Democrat Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick did to Arizona. First, she voted for Obamacare. Then, she walked out on her constituents at a town hall meeting because of her vote. Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick brags about her Obamacare vote. It's also the one I'm most proud about. Now, Arizona's insurance rate hikes are twice the national average. We are losing health care choices with more than half of Arizona counties left with only one option. But even after the Obamacare disaster she says she'd do it all again. We can't afford more failed Obama/Kirkpatrick policies."

Would you prefer this bipartisan leader with a record of fighting for small businesses and putting people before politics, or this partisan political operative who fought for higher taxes on Pennsylvania families? No. The choice is so clear. It has to be Pat Toomey. Toomey for sure. The U.S. Chamber is responsible for the content of this advertising."

,"Coming from a family, ninth of ten kids, the first of my family to go to college. So off to college you went? I did. The first of my family to go to college. And even though I was number nine I was the very first one to go to college in my family. This is where I come from. As ninth of 10 kids. My dad a police officer. And I was the first of my family to go to college."
,"So much of what we are fighting for, what NARAL stands for, is the very simple proposition that all women deserve to have their rights respected. All women deserve to have access to the health services and choices they are entitled to. It should not be that some, who are fortunate economically, can access their rights, while all others are left behind. When I talk like this, the Republicans always seem to find a way to say that I'm playing the gender card. If fighting for equal pay and paid family leave and women's reproductive health care is playing the gender card, just deal me in and let's get it on. We all need a champion in the White House. And not just someone who says the right things, but someone who does them as well. Who will stand up to each and every attack, and who will do everything she can to protect reproductive rights."
,"How many people in this room have had drug addiction affect their families or their friends or their co-workers? Just just raise your hand. Congress is trying to get police some money to help fight the heroin epidemic. It's called CARA, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. Raise your hand. Those of who don't have your hand up look around the room. If this isn't epidemic levels I don't know what is. Senator Rob Portman has been working on a bill to fight heroin for months. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. More people are dying from heroin and prescription drug overdoses than any other cause of death. It focuses on giving treatment to addicts. Second, it launches treatment programs. In preventing people from getting hooked in the first place. I'm I'm hopeful that this legislation cannot only help states, local government and nonprofits to do a better job, but can begin to actually turn this around. The final thing I'll say about it is there is hope. The solution is the prevention. Education. Get these people into treatment and get their lives back together."
,"This feminist voted to cut veterans benefits and to gut the military budget. She sponsored a tax increase in the radical E.R.A and voted to let homosexuals pretend they're married. She's a RINO who voted to fund Obamacare and to raise the debt ceiling twice to pay for abortions in D.C. and to fund Planned Butcherhood. She's pro-amnesty and voted to let convicted alien child molesters stay in America. And you know, as a Republican you can be a RINO. RINO. RINO. I'm Kay Daly and this is my message. I'm hunting RINOs. Care to join me?"
,When child care costs more than your rent. You give 'em Hill.
,Mass shootings. Daily gun violence. But Congress won't act. Now there's good news. New action tightens the loophole that allowed criminals to get guns without a background check. Most Americans. Most gun owners. Most Republicans and Democrats. Even those favorable to the NRA support this action to make our country safer. Keep speaking up for common sense solutions to gun violence. It's working.
,"I think someone deserved to be fired. Veterans were dying just waiting for care at the VA. And Walter Jones is part of the problem. It's a mess that still has to be fixed. He voted against more doctors, more nurses, more options. Walter Jones voted to protect the people who made a mess of the VA. He broke his promise to you. I never will. I'm Taylor Griffin and I approve this message."
,"I think anybody that serves in public office should have a little bit of contempt for government in their heart. Then you are always constantly trying to fix the problem. But I was willing to delve into the details. Get into the nitty gritty. And try and find even down to the pennies ways to save taxpayers money. A lot of people say they want to go to Washington to do this, do that. I want to go to Washington to undo this, to undo that. 'Cause if you take the money out of government's hands, put it into the people's hands. Private citizens, they know how to take one dollar and turn it into two. The government takes one dollar and usually turns it into 50 cents. They don't know how to create jobs. Government does not create profit. Government actually stymies jobs and stymies profits by creating more bureaucracies and more barriers and more burdens. I want to go up there and roll up my sleeves. Do my part. Make a difference and then go home. Carlos Lopez-Cantera for Senate. I'm Carlos Lopez-Cantera and I approved this message."
,"With congressional approval ratings so low, I have had to turn to bringing veterans back to life just to try to up our poll ratings in Congress and increase our approval."

,"Folly. Noun. A lack of good sense. This is David Jolly's Folly. Promising to fight Planned Parenthood, he was the only Republican who voted to end the investigation into their selling of fetal baby parts. Major folly by David Jolly."
,"Wanna shake up Washington? Don't send another politician. Send Ted Budd. See Ted Budd wouldn't be your typical congressman. He's a real conservative. A North Carolina businessman and family man.

,"Why does Governor Jerry Brown support Kamala Harris for U.S. Senate? She's strong, she's intelligent, she knows what she's doing. And the experience of bringing environmental lawsuits, bringing lawsuits against corporate malfeasance and banks, gives her that broad spectrum of experience. Join Jerry Brown, the Sierra Club and the California Democratic Party. Vote Kamala Harris for Senate. She's fearless for the people. I'm Kamala Harris and I approve this message."
,"More than 25 Ohioans are dying every week from drug overdoses. Heroin addiction's become an epidemic that's sweeping across our communities, destroying lives and tearing families apart. Fortunately there's some hope on the way. Working together with Democrats and Republicans, I passed legislation to help break the grip of addiction. By investing in prevention, treatment and recovery, empowering law enforcement in stopping the overprescribing of painkillers, we can turn the tide."
,"I've worked since I was 13. Worked my way through college and raised my three girls. After 45 years on the job I looked forward to retirement. It's something we all deserve. But Senator Kelly Ayotte has a different plan for seniors. Keep working. Ayotte supported a plan to raise the eligibility age for Medicare and turn it into a voucher program, raising out-of-pocket costs for seniors. I don't think Kelly Ayotte's for us.

,Katcho Achadjian voted to limit women's access to an abortion. He voted to restrict women's access to birth control. He voted against maternity care. Katcho Achadjian even supported letting insurance companies charge women more than men. No wonder Katcho Achadjian got a 0% rating from Planned Parenthood. Salud Carbajal will protect a woman's right to make her own health care decisions. That's why Planned Parenthood called Salud Carbajal a champion.

,"Luke Air Force Base is not only by vital to our national security, but also to our local communities and economy. Senator John McCain has been a powerful advocate for the base, taking a bipartisan approach when securing the Fighter Pilot Training Program. Thousands of jobs depend on Luke. Without John McCain's leadership and experience, we could have lost many of those jobs. Without question Senator McCain's leadership has made Arizona and America stronger. I'm John McCain and I approve this message."
,"America depends on top notch fighter pilots, many of whom are produced at Luke Air Force Base. Luke Air Force Base is not only vital to our national security, but also to our local communities and economy. There has not been a stronger advocate in Washington for Luke than Senator John McCain. Thousands of jobs depend on Luke. Without John McCain's leadership and experience, we could have lost many of those jobs. He took a common sense, and a bipartisan approach when working with local and state officials. And together, we secured the Fighter Pilot Training Program, which is so meaningful to all of us. Many of the individuals that pass through Luke Air Force Base, do eventually end up retiring here, because we feel like this is a community that shares those values. And certainly I think John McCain understands those values as well as the cultures and traditions that we hold dear in the military. In strengthening Luke, and in so many other ways, he's made Arizona and America stronger, and he's never wavered. I'm John McCain and I approve this message."
,When Mexico sends its people. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. Are you gonna have a massive deportation force? You're going to have a deportation force.

,Arizona has a lot to be proud of. The beautiful sunsets. The Grand Canyon. The people that make this state great. But what's Ann Kirkpatrick most proud of? It's her vote for Obamacare. It's also the one I'm most proud about. After thousands of votes Kirkpatrick says Obamacare's the one I'm most proud about. She may be proud but Arizona is paying the price. Ann Kirkpatrick. Wrong on Obamacare. Wrong for Arizona. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is responsible for the content of this advertising.
,"I'm Renee Ellmers and I approved this message. Inherited family millions made George Holding one of the richest members of Congress. Yet Holding spent $4,000 of your money, not his, to upgrade just one flight to first class. And thousands more for 12 fancy, fabulous international journeys. All in cahoots with his buddy, John Boehner. Holding's no conservative. He spends your money, not his."

,"Service. For veterans like Marlyn it starts with fixing our broken VA system. For years the Tomah VA put veterans like Marlyn at risk, overprescribing dangerous medicines. Russ Feingold was told but did nothing to help. Then we elected Ron Johnson. As chairman of the Government Affairs Committee he listened and acted. Demanding accountability. Delivering solutions. It's why we need Ron Johnson."
,We all know people who only look out for themselves. As a state official Katie McGinty helped steer millions of taxpayer dollars to companies that promised to hire us. Instead factories shut down and hundreds were fired. But McGinty got hired. She walked away with a board position and a six-figure salary. So whose job does she care about more? Yours or hers?

,"Everyone knows Kelly Ayotte voted against more background checks for gun sales. But now she's trying again to hide her vote from Granite Staters. Kelly's voted for background checks. Three years ago the gun lobby helped hide her vote, making the same claim in their ad. Kelly Ayotte voted for a bipartisan plan to make background checks more effective. And here's how that particular sleight of hand works. It is a standard Washington trick. After Kelly Ayotte stood on the Senate floor as part of a minority that was able to block the will of the majority of the Senate to legislate expanded background checks, she stood on the Senate floor and voted for a fake background check bill so that later she could claim. It's a bill that I did support. If she needed to. Kelly's voted for background checks. That she voted for some kind of background checks. Kelly Ayotte was trying to mislead Granite Staters in 2013 and she's trying to mislead them now. Tell Kelly Ayotte to come clean about her real record. The same one the gun lobby supports."
,"Katie McGinty funneled millions of tax dollars to a group that employed her husband. The State Ethics Commission unanimously denounced such actions and the Supreme Court agreed. An insider with ethics problems, McGinty's not what we need in Washington. Something we need more of? Ed Rendell called Pat Toomey a man of uncommon decency. A bipartisan leader, Pat Toomey is rated one of the hardest-working senators. I'm Pat Toomey and I approved this message."

,"If your words can inspire them to cheer, to go to the polls and vote, to speak out for you, don't you think your words in some way can inspire them to violence and incite violence as well? Don't you understand that you can't say in one term, well I'm getting people to vote for me, but my words have meaning. But then on the other hand my words don't have meaning when it comes to another particular issue? Yeah well I certainly don't incite violence and I certainly would I don't condone violence. Knock the crap out him would you. Seriously. Okay? Just knock the hell. I promise you I will pay for the legal fees. And introduced Trump. Trump spoke for about thirty or so minutes, and when a protester did interrupt. We had some people. Some rough guys like we have right in here. And they started punching back. It was a beautiful thing. I mean they started punching back. In the good old days this doesn't happen because they used to treat them very, very rough. And when they protested once, you know they would not do it again so. I love the old days. You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this?

,"I love Israel. I'm very pro-Israel. I would love to see a deal be made between Israel and the Palestinians. It's probably the hardest negotiation there is. Great negotiators have tried and they failed. It's just so deep-seated. The hatred. The level of distrust. But I'm gonna give it an awfully good shot. I want to remain as neutral as possible because if you're not somewhat neutral, the other side is never going to do it. But just remember Israel, I love you. We're gonna see if we can get something done. It has to be done for both sides. It cannot continue to be the way it is. Let's see what we can negotiate. Let's see if it can be done."

,"My record is is mixed and spotty, and I can be criticized for that. Retread Ted's record? Strickland spent over a decade in Washington but wasn't able to offer a single bill that became law. As governor, Ohio lost over 350,000 jobs. Then Strickland went back to D.C. to run the lobbying arm of a liberal special-interest group. That was a dream job. Paid me more money than I've ever made in my life. Retread Ted. We can't go back."

,"All the pipes have been stripped out. Anything of value in here is gone. This is a cathedral to addiction, because the people break in, they strip the copper out, and they sell it for pennies and this is what happens. What would our country look like if 30 years ago we didn't declare a war on drugs, but we declared a war on addiction and treated it like the medical condition that it is? How many millions of families' lives would not have been damaged or destroyed by seeing their loved ones get sent away for years and years through mandatory minimum sentencing? Who'd want to live next to this? I don't know. But what's remarkable to remember is that families grew up here. People that had jobs, people that had lives and at one point in time this was a beautiful home for some family and that's changed. I'm John Fetterman and I approve this message because something needs to change."

I'm Kathleen Matthews, Democrat for Congress, and I approve this message. Paid for by Kathleen Matthews for Congress."
,"Meet Merrick Garland. Obama and his liberal allies have been working hard to paint Garland as a moderate for the Supreme Court. But there is no painting over the truth. Garland would be the tie-breaking vote for Obama's big-government liberalism. The Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. Gutted. Partial-birth abortion. Legalized. Unaccountable agencies like the EPA. Unleashed. How do we know? Because we have seen Garland's record and it's not moderate. In two separate cases Garland has demonstrated his strong hostility to gun owner rights. He even sided with the federal government on keeping personal information on anyone who purchases a gun. Unaccountable agencies like the EPA, in a dozen close cases in which the court divided, he sided with the agency every time. According to The New York Times if Judge Garland is confirmed, he could tip the ideological balance to create the most liberal Supreme Court in 50 years. Moderate? Nice try."
,He's ignored the Constitution for years. Now in his last days President Obama wants to add a liberal justice to the Supreme Court. Even The New York Times says this would create the most liberal Supreme Court in 50 years. The NRA says it would lead to Americans losing their ability to own firearms for protection. Small business leaders know it would kill jobs. Don't let President Obama and Senator Bennett stack the Supreme Court. Let the people decide.
,"Look at this. This bridge has been closed because it is not structurally sound enough to accommodate the weight of a bus. This is another bridge that was shut down and drastically alter the public transportation. And this is bridge number three. What's wrong with our political system? The money that that anyone would have to spend to win a Senate race in this country could fix the three bridges in my community, and that to me is what's perverse and crazy about this post-Citizens United world. There's a complete dislocation between the political establishment and the reality on the ground here. You know there isn't anybody in Washington that lives in a community that's facing issues like this. I'm John Fetterman and I approve this message because something needs to change."
,"Ted Strickland talks tough on China. The truth? Rob Portman is fighting against China, standing up to his own party to stop China's currency manipulation. Protecting Ohio jobs when China cheats. And Ted Strickland? In Congress, Strickland refused to hold China accountable for unfair trade practices. As Governor, Strickland opened a trade office in China, then gave a four million dollar loan to a company with a Chinese factory. Retread Ted. Weak on China. Wrong on jobs."

However, after a lot of thought, I believe that Ted Cruz is the best choice for conservatives who want an outsider. You know I plan to go to Washington and be a senator much like Ted Cruz. One who speaks out, who works for conservative principles and stands up to the political class. My unique background as a leader, attacking waste in variation and telling the truth, even when it's uncomfortable, differentiates me from the rest of this field. I look forward to working with President Ted Cruz, and together driving Colorado and America forward."

,"Sanctuary cities. That's when a city refuses to cooperate with immigration enforcement, at times letting violent criminals loose on the streets, instead of allowing them to be deported. Pat Toomey has lead the fight to stop dangerous sanctuary cities, but Katie McGinty supports them. That's right. Katie McGinty wants to keep extreme sanctuary policies in place like Philadelphia's. Even former Governor Ed Rendell and the Obama Administration say Philadelphia's sanctuary city policy goes too far, but not liberal Katie McGinty. She calls opposition to sanctuary cities just buzzwords. McGinty's wrong and her policy is putting Pennsylvania lives in danger. On this and on so many other important issues, there's a clear difference. Katie McGinty supports dangerous sanctuary cities. Pat Toomey is fighting to stop them.

I mean we could say politically correct that the look doesn't matter but the look obviously matters. Like you wouldn't have your job if you weren't beautiful.

Polls show Trump could even lose heavily Republican states like Mississippi and Utah.

Trump has a long history of insulting women, calling them bimbos, dogs, fat pigs. No wonder 70 percent of women view Trump unfavorably. Trump's reckless rhetoric has led to campaign violence.

She was the principal of Sandy Hook School. My mom was murdered while trying to protect the children in her care from a gunman. No more families should have to go through what we have. Hillary Clinton is the only candidate that has what it takes to take on the gun lobby. No one is fighting harder to reform our gun laws than Hillary. She reminds me of my mother.

His proposed 35% tariff-like penalties would instigate a trade war. His tax plan would balloon the deficit and the national debt. His bankruptcies have crushed small businesses, and the men and women who work for them. He inherited his business, he didn't create it. And whatever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then there's Trump Magazine. And Trump Vodka. And Trump Steaks. And Trump Mortgage. A business genius, he is not. After all, this is an individual who mocked a disabled reporter. Who attributed a reporter's questions to her menstrual cycle. Who mocked a brilliant rival who happened to be a woman due to her appearance. Who bragged about his marital affairs. And who laces his public speeches with vulgarity. He's not of the temperament of the kind of stable, thoughtful person we need as leader. His imagination must not be married to real power. He creates scapegoats in Muslims and Mexican immigrants. He calls for the use of torture. He calls for killing the innocent children and family members of terrorists. He cheers assaults on protesters. He applauds the prospect of twisting the Constitution to limit First Amendment freedom of the press. This is the very brand of anger that has led other nations into the abyss. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He's playing the members of the American public for suckers. And this is a time for choosing. God bless us to choose a nominee who will make that vision a reality. Thank you and God bless you all."

,"It's an American story, isn't it. Growing up on a struggling family farm lost to the bank. Starting out with one store and growing it into 150 of them. Creating thousands of well-paying jobs along the way. Taking that improbable success and sharing it. And that's American too. The best part of America. David Trone offering free GEDs for thousands of employees and domestic partner benefits when no one else was doing it. And spending more than 20 years fighting to make criminal justice a little more just. When you come from a struggling family, you help struggling families. So he had this notion. Take that real-life experience of getting things done to a place where hardly anything gets done. So he's the only candidate for Congress with a plan to reduce college debt, to ensure the minimum wage keeps up with inflation, to stop the scourge of Alzheimer's and strengthen the promise we make with every working American. Occasionally David likes to come back to that lost farm, but in every way that matters, he's never really left. I'm David Trone and I approve this message."

,"Wealth. Power. Privilege. Some people are born into the club. It's the Rob Portman story. Old money and exclusive schools. Over 30 years ago Portman went to Washington to join a politically-connected lobbying firm, and he's been working for the rich and powerful ever since. A dedicated outsourcer he's been one of the nation's biggest cheerleaders for trade agreements that have cost millions of American jobs, from NAFTA to CAFTA to fast-tracking the TPP, Portman's never met a free trade agreement he didn't like. For years he's been a pushover for China. It was his job to stop China's illegal dumping of steel. He failed. Looked the other way. Did nothing. And Ohio paid the price. Instead Portman rewarded China with permanent Most Favored Nation status. In Congress he voted for a plan that eliminated overtime pay for six million American workers and supported raising the retirement age for Social Security. As Budget Director he proposed cutting Medicare. In the Senate he voted to cut Pell Grants and opposed the automobile rescue, calling it a lousy deal for Ohio. He's done so much to protect the big banks and Wall Street CEOs, one lobbyist said Portman's face belongs on the Mount Rushmore of the financial services industry. And when the Republican leadership said they wouldn't even hold hearings for a Supreme Court nominee, Rob Portman fell in line and did what he was told. Because falling in line is what you do when you've spent your whole life as a member of the club. Rob Portman. The ultimate Washington insider. This November, let's break up the club."

My son was a very gentle individual. Everybody used to call him the big teddy bear. It was very funny going to the store with Sandy. She would rearrange your food. She would even put things back on the shelf because it wasn't good for you. She was unlawfully arrested as a result of a traffic stop. So, she lost her life due to a traffic stop. Dontre was my youngest. Dontre had a smile that would uplift your spirits. Dontre was killed by a Milwaukee Police Officer. There was no indictment. The worst day of my life was when I had to bury my seventeen year-old son. Each of us has has lived through our own tragedies, which are all different. I just want people to understand that Sandy was so much more than that orange jumpsuit in a box. I read the Michael Brown story, and at that point, it was like, no, not another one. At that point, I decided that I wanted to be their voice. As a mother who lost her child, I was going to stand up and challenge the system, and continue to tell my story. I can't help Trayvon at this time, but there are other Trayvon Martin's that I can help. It's a story of a lot of young, black males in this country. Our young men and women are being murdered, and nobody is being held accountable. We're just not going to stand for this now. This is my life. Work to get justice. Gun violence prevention.

,"Bimbo. Dog. Fat pig. Real quotes from Donald Trump about women. A person who is very flat-chested is very hard to be a 10. I'd look her right in that fat, ugly face of hers. Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? She had the height. She had the beauty. She was crazy. But these are minor details. I like kids. I mean I won't do anything to take care of them. I'll supply funds and she'll take care of the kids. You know it really doesn't matter what they write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of ***. That must be a pretty picture. You dropping to your knees. There was blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her wherever. Women. You have to treat em like ****. This is how Donald Trump talks about our mothers.

Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil companies. The indifference, the negligence. That's what I want to take on.

,"Republican candidate John Kasich will be spending the day here in our great state. Governor of the neighboring state of Ohio. I've really been struggling I think like most people have been as far as who they're gonna choose for a candidate. You know, he mentioned in the last debate that he was the only grown up on the stage and I really do, I feel that. I think he's the only one that's really mature enough to handle the position and he is very experienced at what he does. I made my decision to vote for him two weeks ago. I never pick my candidates out of fear. I picked those with practical solutions. John Kasich has the experience. I always liked him when he was a congressman. I thought he was very well-spoken. I liked his ideas. He's done a great job as governor of Ohio. He's proven he's an effective chief executive. This is a sincere individual that each and every day that he's president, you could be proud of him. You may not agree with him every day, but you can be proud of him and you know that you'll be listening to you and working in your best interest.

,"In making deals, even if it's big deals with Congress or maybe other countries, it really takes a certain amount of common sense. You have to have personality. You have to size up the other side.

You wanna make great deals for our country. You have to get people together. When you're dealing in Congress, we have to get em all into a room and we have to say fellas, let's go. It's for the good of the people. We want to take care of the people. It's been a long time. It's been decades since this has happened. We're going to take care of the people.

,"When my oldest brother Michael was born, my mother was told that she had to leave because she could not bring a black child into that neighborhood. So she left and she tried to make a way for herself and her child on the southside. We lived in extreme poverty. I remember being sent downstairs to put snow in the bucket, and then taking that water and pouring it into the back of a toilet so that we could flush it because we didn't have running water that month. I remember that existence. I didn't go to college straight from high school cause I didn't think I would succeed. After my first semester, I had straight A's. Second semester, straight A's. When I looked at this report card and I thought what gave me such a low assessment of myself that I thought I wouldn't succeed here? Then I decided then and there that I was going to be a teacher so that any kid who came through my classroom would not walk away from my classroom not understanding his or her potential the way I did. I saw that photograph of Bernie Sanders chained to a black woman protesting segregation in the 1960s. That photograph tells me more about his willingness to fight for the rights of all people than anything any politician has ever said. Being able to have a college education transformed my view of what I could be in this world. It shouldn't just be a small group of people who get access to that kind of experience. Every American, regardless of their income, should have access to a college education. These things are possible. The impossible is possible. And that's one of the reasons that I love Bernie Sanders. He sees an America that's beyond the current limitations that we have. He sees an America that I see, where there's hope. Where things you thought could never be done can be done. That is why I support Bernie Sanders. I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message."
,"Donald Trump campaign violence. I'd like to punch him in the face. Knock the crap out of him. They'd be carried out on a stretcher folks. I promise you I will pay for the legal fees.

Today Michelle Fields, a reporter for the conservative website Breitbart, said earlier this week Trump's campaign manager grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down. Field's showed us the bruise where she says Trump's campaign manager grabbed her. They're not telling the truth. There's videos. There's pictures. There's an eyewitness of a Washington Post reporter. Another supporter arrested for assault. A Trump supporter is under arrest tonight after punching a protester at a rally.

,"It was a socialist, communist revolution. My grandfather was arrested in 1960 and he was imprisoned. He was targeted like many, many others were just because he represented everything that the Castro regime did not. They came to our house and simply took em, and arrested them for no reason at all.

Stood up against all the lobbyists. We did it for Carol Price and all the other moms, and all the other families. Oil companies were planning on coming into the Chesapeake Bay and drilling. I was proud to lead the fight to ban drilling the bay. He stood up to the oil companies and he won the fight. I saw when Republicans in Washington tried to cut our Social Security benefits.

,"Ohio's changed the world. From small steps to giant leaps. We've reached for the heavens and found the light. Our great state has done great things. Together, in the face of a national recession, we turned Ohio around. We challenged the old way of doing business.

Many would consider sugar subsidies, which you've supported, the type of favoritism that you generally reject. That's been my position forever and the reason why is because I believe agriculture, unlike any other industry, it should to be treated a little differently and that's always been my position.

,"For the last USA Today poll had me beating Hillary Clinton by 11 points, more than anybody on this stage. Secondly, I hope you saw tonight that executive experience really matters. It matters in terms of growing our economy, balancing budgets, cutting taxes, reforming regulations. I've done it in Washington. I've done it in Ohio. And I can go back to Washington and do it again. But I hope you'll also notice tonight that I do have the foreign policy experience. Not just a few years, but a lot of years. In working with some of the great great minds in this country to develop the expertise, the confidence, the firmness, the toughness and the ability to bring people together. I hope you all think about giving me your vote. I would appreciate it very much and I tell you. We won't have to spend time figuring out what we're going to do. I will hit the ground running and we will get America moving again. Thank you all very much."

,"Marco Rubio is a recognized foreign policy expert. And Donald Trump? He praises Putin. Doesn't know what our nuclear weapons triad is. Says he'd be neutral between Israel and its enemies.

Sanders has the most far-reaching plan to fight climate change and build a clean energy future. Bernie Sanders. People before polluters. I'm Bernie Sanders and I approved this message.
,"This is Governor Greg Abbott. It is our duty as Texas conservatives to support a leader that we can trust to restore our values. That's why I am supporting Ted Cruz for President. Unlike far too many in Washington, the Ted Cruz we've seen in the Senate is the same at Ted Cruz we elected. And he's the same Ted Cruz I served with when I was the Attorney General. And Ted was our solicitor general. Conservative values are at his core. He's principled, he's fearless and he has true conviction. Ted is a constitutionalist whose judgment I trust to appoint the right judges to the United States Supreme Court. To my fellow Texas conservatives, I say this. We need to deliver. This is our time. Ted Cruz is our candidate. Now let's do our part to take this country back."

In the House of Delegates, I have a proven record of conservative leadership. I've helped reduce taxes for families and businesses, joined Governor Hogan in passing the most fiscally responsible budget in forty years, led the fight against Common Core, and helped hold the line in protecting individual liberties that our constitution grants. Just as I had put these boots on the ground serving our country in combat, continued by serving our community in the state legislature, I will do the same in the U.S. Congress. I'm David Vogt and I humbly ask you to allow me to continue my service by representing you in Congress."
,"With so much at stake, we can't afford to take a chance on this election. Ted Cruz is the only candidate who has taken on the Washington cartel time after time and won.

Ted Cruz went to the Supreme Court, and fought for religious liberty and the Ten Commandments, beating back the liberal agenda. Ted Cruz, a real-life conservative leader ready on day one.

,"Leading Ohio newspapers agree. Ted Strickland was a failed governor. The Columbus Dispatch said Strickland was in over his head. The Cleveland Plain Dealer once said Strickland did an appalling job and that timidity was his real undoing. Even Democrats say Strickland is yesterday's news. Now Ohio editorial writers are saying the following. Strickland should get out and stay out, calling his senate candidacy a sorry statement, and a retread that signals the death of the Democratic Party. They say it's difficult to imagine that Ohioans wouldn't want to hang onto Portman, calling Strickland yesterday's bad news. Under Ted Strickland, Ohio lost more than 350,000 jobs. Ted Strickland was a lousy governor. He'd be a worse senator. Don't let Retread Ted take Ohio backwards again."
,"When Ted Strickland was governor, Ohio's unemployment rate soared to over 10 percent. On his watch, employers left the state and good-paying jobs disappear. 1200 jobs were lost in Dayton when NCR moved to Georgia. 400 jobs lost in Cincinnati when U.S. Playing Card Company moved to Kentucky. Over 100 jobs were lost in Columbus, when Axiobionics moved to Michigan and General Products Corporation moved to Indiana. When DHL closed in Wilmington, another 8,000 jobs were lost and the list goes on. Because when Ted Strickland was governor, Ohio was almost dead last in job creation. We lost over 350,000 jobs. We can't go back."
,"The power of the American people when we rise up and stand for liberty knows no bounds. There is no one in my generation who has done more to champion constitutional conservative causes than Ted Cruz. Over and over again, when we faced impossible odds, the American people rose to the challenge. I don't know of any place that's harder to stand up and fight and win than the United States Supreme Court, whether it's defending 2nd Amendment rights or protecting United States sovereignty against the United Nations. He led. He fought. And he won. I believe in you. If you're ready to join a grassroots army across this nation, I'm gonna ask you to stand together for liberty."

She's the one that brought this to another level of attention and that's what we needed. If what had been happening in Flint had happened in Grosse Pointe or Bloomfield Hills, I think we all know we would have had a solution yesterday. Hillary Clinton really cares about people.

,"When we arrived in South Carolina yesterday, this was The State newspaper. Clinton camp hits Obama. Attacks painful for black voters. Many in state offended by criticism of Obama and remarks about Martin Luther King. Dr. King's dream began to be realized when President Lyndon Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It's as if you are minimizing I Have A dream. It's a nice sentiment, but it took a white President to get blacks to the mountain top. The damage between the Clintons and the African-Americans in this country might be irreparable. Senator Obama's support among hard working Americans, white Americans, is weakening. Clinton had said a few years ago this guy would have been getting us coffee. I am not a racist. This whole thing is the biggest fairy tale. Geraldine Ferraro's comment to the newspaper that quote if Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position. The Clinton campaign doesn't want to change the tone. They're defending this and this, therefore this is their strategy."

,LGBT Americans know better than most that the Supreme Court can have a huge impact on our lives. Just last year the court made the right to marry the law of the land. But we're not done. We're not done. There's still plenty at stake for the LGBT community that could be decided by the Court. It's still legal for private employers to fire someone for being gay in 28 states and for being trans in 30 states. Just recently a federal judge ruled that a transgender student was not protected against discrimination at his school under Title Nine of the Civil Rights Act. Another judge ruled that sexual orientation was not protected by current employment discrimination law under Title Seven. All of these issues and more could make their way to the Supreme Court in the coming years. That's why it's so critical for our community that President Obama's nominees are confirmed by the Senate. Whoever President Obama appoints could provide the critical vote on legislation impacting our lives.

,"I'm Richard Burr and I approved this message. Washington's become disconnected from the American people. Nothing happens in this country, especially big things, without the American people. The wrong place for government to be is inbetween the people and their doctor. Health care reforms should be towards creating a system where individuals should have the ability to negotiate their own health care. The wrong thing to do is to create one system and ask everybody to play in it. Washington believes that it's the solution, when what the American people expect is a common sense approach."
,A woman's right to control her own health care is something that's very important to me. The very first conversation that I had with Bernie Sanders was on this issue. Bernie has spent his entire career defending a woman's right to choose. I'm the mother of two daughters. This is critical to me. I would not be standing behind Bernie Sanders if he didn't have a 100% record on a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. This is a deal-breaker and he is a champion for a woman's right to choose. I'm Bernie Sanders and I approved this message.
,"Being President is more than the economy or health care.

,"Former President George W. Bush joined his brother Jeb tonight for a rally in North Charleston. South Carolina is Bush country. The President of the United States, George W. Bush. The presidency is a serious job, and there's no doubt in my mind that Jeb Bush has the experience and the character to be a great president. Here's the challenge. Everybody's got a lot of ideas, but who has actually rolled up their sleeves and taken the hits? He's got the backbone necessary to make the tough decisions on behalf of the American people. Who's done it? I don't see if you see the scar. This is the one where we created the first voucher program in the country. Who's created the environment to make sure that we can grow our economy at a faster rate? These aren't easy things to do. I didn't cut and run. If you want someone with a proven record. He will stand on principle. Someone with 32 years of private sector experience. He will not waiver in the wind. A solid conservative. And he will always do what's right. Then you're looking at the nominee for the Republican nomination. And I can beat Hillary Clinton. I can promise you that."
,"Going back to the old neighborhood can be hard sometimes. Walls have been built invisibly around the old neighborhood and that police brutality is used to keep folks hemmed in. And frankly, opportunity locked out. I spent my entire life in the civil rights movement.

,"We as a nation have faced troubling times before. In fact thirty-six years ago this nation faced a period of doubt. After a failed presidency, it felt like America was in decline, our economy was stagnant and the American Dream felt like it was slipping away. And then we elected a President that inspired us. A President who asked us to remember who we were and who believed as we do, that America's greatest days always lie ahead. Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan made us believe that it was morning in America again, and it was. Well now the children of the Reagan revolution are ready to assume the mantle of leadership."

,"John Kasich says he supports women and families. So why does he want to defund Planned Parenthood, cut programs that prevent infant mortality, and end important domestic violence prevention initiatives? Why would Kasich cut funding for lifesaving breast and cervical cancer screenings, and 50,000 tests that stop the spread of HIV and other diseases? All while 65% of Ohioans support funding for Planned Parenthood. Tell Governor Kasich his actions speak louder than words. It's time to stand up for women's health."
,"I'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message. Her church taught her to do all the good you can, for all the people you can, for as long as you can. After law school, she could have joined a high price law firm, but instead she worked to reform juvenile justice in South Carolina, exposed racism in Alabama schools, registered Latino voters in Texas, and provided legal aid to families in Arkansas. Her life's work has been about breaking barriers and so would her presidency. Which is why for every American who is not being paid what they're worth, who's held back by student debt, or a system tilted against them, and there are far too many of you, she understands that our country can't reach its potential unless we all do. Together, a stronger country."
,"Almost every element of the ad's a lie. Senator Rand Paul says conservatives are lying about his record, but where does he really stand? Do you still think Iran is not a threat as you said in 2007? Yeah, 2007 was a long time ago. He keeps trying to explain it away. The ad is basically trying to say that your policies are similar to that are for of Obama, it's dangerous to the United States, and your siding with Obama. You know, things do change over time. I was campaigning to help my father at the time. But the truth is out there. I'm one of the senators who's in favor of negotiations with Iran. You know, it's ridiculous to think that they're a threat to our national security. Our national security is not threatened by Iran having one nuclear weapon. Tell Rand Paul to stop siding with Obama. Because even one Iranian bomb would be a disaster."
,"Up next, it's Rob Portman, attempting a triple aerial flip-flop. Rob's been practicing it his whole career, supporting one bad trade deal after another, sending hundreds of thousands of jobs to China.

,"Iran, North Korea, ISIS. Threats to America are growing, but under Obama our military is shrinking. So why did John Kasich spend his career supporting massive defense cuts? We're gonna make the Pentagon a triangle. I'm thrilled. I've spent a whole career trying to rein in defense spending. Kasich wanted cuts so severe, even Bill Clinton said they would harm defense.

,"Ohio was a big manufacturing state, and we still are, but I want to tell you Ohio and America has been damaged as a result of the willingness to take Ohio jobs, manufacturing jobs, good-paying jobs, and have them shipped to China, and there's no issue that separates me and Rob Portman more clearly than this issue of trade. He has been an outsourcer of Ohio jobs and through his history, Rob Portman always chooses his special interest friends over Ohio's working people.

,"Former Governor Ted Strickland is making a big announcement. I'm going to be giving a national security speech and I intend to go into my position on these matters in very significant detail. So what is Strickland's record on national security? Ted Strickland supports Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's failed national security policies that have made America weaker and ISIS stronger. Ted even led the lobbying arm of a liberal D.C. special interest group that supported the Obama agenda. Policies that have weakened our national defense. Drawing red lines that were ignored, and left us more vulnerable to attacks from ISIS and other terrorist groups. Because America has been leading from behind. And Governor Strickland continues to support President Obama's nuclear deal with Iran, even though it gives Iran billions of dollars. Money it can now use to support terrorist groups. And even though Iran continues to violate international rules. We can't trust Ted Strickland's bad judgment. Ted Strickland. Wrong for Ohio. Wrong for a safer America."
,"Which presidential candidate voted with Nancy Pelosi to cut troop levels and military funding? And supported expanding Obamacare? If you guessed Bernie Sanders, you're half right.

But with Kasich's record, maybe he should. Right To Rise USA is responsible for the content of this message."
,"Since moving from Washington D.C. to Ohio to run for Senate, Ted Strickland's been having a tough time. Fellow Democrats say it was a mistake for the Democratic Party to endorse him. Some are doubting his candidacy and preparing to go on the attack. Now, Ted is hiding, refusing to discuss his record of failure that hurt Ohio families and cost Ohio jobs, or his plan to impose higher taxes and burdensome regulations. He's been a ghost. He's not been speaking to any of the issues. Fellow Democrats are saying his campaign seems to be modeled after a stealth aircraft. You can't see him. Pundits say Strickland has been disappointing and invisible on the issues. Ted Strickland. A failed record. Failed ideas for the future. Don't let Retread Ted take Ohio backwards."
,"We know Ted Strickland failed as our governor. Ohio lost over three hundred and fifty thousand jobs, and was ranked 48th in job creation. But Congressman Strickland's record in Washington was just as troubling. Strickland spent more than a decade in Congress and sponsored zero bills that became law. Ted Strickland didn't even bother to show up for work, at one point skipping forty percent of his votes, one of the worst records in all of Congress. And after Ohio fired Ted Strickland as governor, he went back to D.C. to cash in, working for a liberal special-interest group. I want to tell you, I had a job last year that was a dream job. Paid me more money than I've ever made in my life. Strickland's D.C. dream job meant lobbying for a liberal group that supports policies that hurt Ohio families. Obamacare, higher taxes and job-killing regulations. Ted Strickland. A record of failure everywhere. Don't let Retread Ted take Ohio backwards again."
,"Drug addiction tears families apart. Just devastating to our communities, our state and our country. Today, sadly drug overdoses are the leading cause of death in Ohio. Too many are unable to achieve their god-given purpose because of this disease. As a father, my heart breaks for these families. We need to fight back. In my hometown of Cincinnati, I founded the coalition for a drug-free greater Cincinnati. My efforts were successful in reducing teen drug abuse. Since then, I've worked with experts around the country on a half dozen bipartisan laws to help with drug prevention and treatment. Like the Drug Free Communities Act, which helped launch 2000 community anti-drug coalitions across the country. I've worked to help states prevent prescription drugs from being sold illegally across state lines and to provide resources to address drug abuse in our schools, to stop the problem before it starts. And our new legislation, the comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act combats the prescription drug and heroin addiction crisis. We've made progress, but there's still a lot of work left to do. To help communities, to help families and to help people get their lives back on track."

,"Thinking about voting for Donald Trump? Think about this. First, liberal judges banned school prayer. Then they legalized abortion. They forced us to educate illegal aliens.

Marco Rubio is trying to distract voters from his own Gang of 8 amnesty bill. Ted Cruz has proven he's willing to lead. He'll secure our border. He'll take the fight to the terrorists. And he'll keep our country safe. I'm Ted Cruz and I approved this message."
,"I'm Dr. James Dobson, speaking to you as a private citizen. My wife Shirley and I have joined thousands of conservative pastors and laymen in endorsing Senator Ted Cruz for President. For us, the sanctity of human life and traditional marriage are non-negotiable. Ted has been relentless in defending the institution of the family. After Donald Trump and Marco Rubio announced that they would accept the Supreme Court's ruling on gay marriage, we knew we could not support them. Our decision was confirmed when they opposed Senator Cruz efforts to defund Planned Parenthood. I know Ted. He's a Christian family man of the utmost integrity. His wife Heidi will be the very first pro-life First Lady. With Justice Scalia's death, we need a President who will defend the Constitution and nominate conservatives to the high court. His name is Ted Cruz. I'm Ted Cruz and I approved this message."
,"Justice Scalia's death reminds us the next President will pick as many as four Supreme Court justices and hundreds of other federal judges. Just who would Donald Trump pick? One person Trump suggested took Roy Moore off the Alabama Supreme Court for displaying the Ten Commandments. Another forced Indiana to fund Planned Parenthood. And one more, who threw out New Jersey's partial-birth abortion ban. Everything is on the line now. Our rights. Our freedoms. Our America. And the courts are the battleground. So who do you trust? Who do you trust to fill our federal courts? Donald Trump with his New York values? Or Ted Cruz, who won cases before the Supreme Court, protecting gun rights, religious freedom and against the world court. Saturday's our last chance, South Carolina. Don't blow it. Ted Cruz for President. Let's take our country back now before it's too late. Courageous Conservatives PAC paid for this ad and is solely responsible for its contents.

,"I'm Ted Cruz and I approved this message. When Marco Rubio ran for Senate, he promised. I will never support. Never have, and never will, support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered or stayed in this country illegally. Then Rubio got to Washington and wrote the bill giving amnesty to illegals, using Obama's talking points to make his sales pitch. We know we have to deal with the 11 million people that are here illegally. We have to deal with the 11 million individuals who are here illegally. The bill that Senator Rubio put forward I think is a great place to start. You are giving legal status to people who have broken the law. They still have to qualify for it, meaning. Passing a background check. Passed a background check. Paying a penalty. Pay a fine. Paying taxes. Start paying taxes. It won't be a quick process. That is a long path. But it will be a fair process. But I do think it's fair. Marco Rubio burned us once. He shouldn't get the chance to sell us out again."
,"Marco Rubio says he has the best foreign policy experience of any candidate. Let's take a look. A freshman senator. One of many on the Foreign Relations Committee. But no major accomplishments. Way too often, Rubio didn't even show up. That's it. What other junior Senator had the same resume? And how did that foreign policy expert work out? Marco Rubio simply isn't ready for the biggest job in the world. Right To Rise USA is responsible for the content of this message."
,"Marco Rubio. Thin record. Clear priorities. He introduced a bill allowing bosses to deny birth control coverage to their employees. He repeatedly voted to defund Planned Parenthood, which provides vital health care to millions of Americans. Worse yet, Rubio not only opposes abortion, but goes further than most Republicans. He'd ban abortion, even in the case of rape and incest. He's shown his priorities. The question is, are they yours? NARAL Pro-Choice America is responsible for the content of this advertising."

Basically a Democrat."
,"Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability. Bernie Sanders. He was there when Dr. King marched on Washington. Unafraid to challenge the status quo to end racial profiling, take on police misconduct, and take down a system that profits from mass imprisonment. There is no President who will fight harder to end institutional racism. Education. Opportunity. Reform. Bernie. I'm Bernie Sanders and I approved this message."
,"I announce my candidacy for President of the United States. When we got into this and when you, when Marco got into this, you prayed about it. Marco prayed about it. So did I and we, we ultimately made a decision that this is something that Marco felt so passionate, you know, in, in wanting to do. I also felt that as his wife and as, as his partner, and feeling what he does feel for what, you know, what this country and the opportunity to give back, that it was important for us to do this. And I say this is us because we're a team. Being an American to me is a gift and it's one of the things that, one of the principles that I want to teach my kids. You know, my mom struggled a lot. It was very difficult for her when she became a single mom because she had to figure out how to put food on the table, how to make sure we had electricity. It was difficult. It makes everything so much harder. Marco's parents, they were amazing people. I mean, his mom is amazing. They came into the country, his mom being a maid and his father being a bartender, trying to raise four kids. That wasn't easy. Just seeing the impact that they made for their sacrifice of, of being able to give their kids education, a stable environment, a home. This country gives you a chance of being able to give your kids what you wouldn't be able to get in other, in other places. I'm just so glad they're on the road with me, and in so many ways, this campaign is about them, about what kind of America they're going to inherit. What kind of America your kids are going to inherit. And it always makes it better when they're with me so I thank. It's amazing because I see so much of Marco in all of my kids. You know, Daniella's passion. I mean, Marco, when he dives into something, when he wants to know about an issue, he, he's in, he just, he's going to know everything about it. Amanda's very deep, loves to read books. And Anthony is the same way. Such a good boy and Dominick is just very charismatic, and I think that, so many of my kids, I see so much of that in, in, so much of them in Marco. Family is a gift. God, I mean, God has given us such a gift. I cannot be more thankful."
,"Our job is not to divide. Our job is to bring people together. If we do not allow them to divide us up by race, by sexual orientation, by gender. By not allowing them to divide us up by whether or not we were born in America or whether we're immigrants. When we stand together as white and black and Hispanic and gay and straight and woman and man. When we stand together and demand that this country works for all of us rather than the few, we will transform America and that is what this campaign is about. It's bringing people together. Together."
,"Who is Jeb Bush relative to all the other quote-unquote conservatives? I am the most proven conservative with the most proven conservative record. I do believe that life begins at conception. My faith makes me believe that. As an NRA member for the past 15 years, the sound of our guns is the sound of freedom. I'm the most pro-life governor on this stage. I had one year when I signed six pro gun and hunting bills. That was a record for Florida. No one has that consistent, proven record."
,"She was gonna really look to impeach Bush and get him out of office, which personally I think would have been a wonderful thing. Impeaching him? The World Trade Center came down during the reign. He kept us safe? that's not safe."
,"I'm Ted Cruz and I approved this message. Between sips of wine and bites of salad, a Planned Parenthood doctor discusses getting money for tissue from aborted fetuses. Harvesting the organs of aborted fetuses for money. Planned Parenthood treats the unborn like another form of currency and yet some politicians still defend them. Planned Parenthood serves a good function. With the debt we have, should we even give them a penny? We have to look at the positive. Donald Trump is just plain wrong."
,"It's morning again in America. Today, more men and women are out of work than ever before in our nation's history. People paying more in taxes than they will for food, housing and clothing combined. Nearly 20 trillion dollars in national debt for the next generation. Double what it was just eight years ago. This afternoon, almost 6,000 men and women will be married. And with growing threats and growing government, they'll look forward with worry to the future. It's morning again in America, and under the leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, our country is more vulnerable, divided and diminished than ever before. Why would we ever want four more years again of that?"

Trump is the only one saying you're gonna be dealt with, we're gonna enforce that. We're gonna enforce that. That's a beautiful thing. I believe Donald Trump wants to make us great again and he loves America."
,"I'm Ted Cruz and I approved this message. Life. Marriage. Religious liberty. The 2nd Amendment. We're just one Supreme Court Justice away from losing them all. Would President Trump ban partial-birth abortions? Well look, I'm, I'm very pro-choice. But you would not ban it? No. Or ban partial-birth abortions. No. I would. I am, I am pro-choice in every respect. We cannot trust Donald Trump with these serious decisions."
,"John Kasich says he supports women and families. So why does he want to defund Planned Parenthood, cut programs that prevent infant mortality, and end important domestic violence prevention initiatives? Why would Kasich cut funding for lifesaving breast and cervical cancer screenings, and 50,000 tests that stop the spread of HIV and other diseases? All while 65% of Ohioans support funding for Planned Parenthood. Tell Governor Kasich his actions speak louder than words. It's time to stand up for women's health."
,"I'm Ted Cruz and I approved this message. I'm very capable of changing to anything I want to change to. That's for sure. Would President Trump ban partial-birth abortions? Well look, I am pro-choice in every respect. But you would not ban it? No. And Planned Parenthood? Planned Parenthood serves a good function. And Hillary Clinton? I think she does a good job and I like her. South Carolina cannot trust Donald Trump. I'm very capable of changing to anything I want to change to. Don't give him that chance."
,"I think track records are very important. Fiorina was HP CEO for six years. She has a track record for nothing else other than running this company. Fair enough. And she ran it aground. People spend a lot of time talking about their track record. Industry analysts broadly agree that Fiorina made some big mistakes in her corporate career. Track record of leadership is vital. She's fired more than 30,000 employees while gifting herself huge bonuses. Shareholder wealth was slashed in half. Track record. This is still her mess. Ten years later, a hundred thousand jobs have been lost. I think track records are very important."

,"Rand Paul supported Obama's negotiations with Iran. I'm kind of one of the senators who's in favor of negotiations with Iran. This is where I differ from some Republicans. I still am in favor of continued negotiation. Obama made a deal with big consequences. Sanctions erased. More money for terrorism. Iran's nuclear program remains. Just years from a bomb. So tell Rand Paul he was wrong to trust Obama, because we can't afford the consequences of this deadly deal."
,"Rand Paul supported President Obama's negotiations with Iran. Well I'm I'm kind of one of the senators who's in favor of negotiations with Iran. I've been a big proponent of negotiation.

And I just watched him. I watched what he was saying and I listened very carefully. And I don't understand the controversy. It's common sense. It's good government. It's so many good things.

I would rather lose an election than be wrong on the issue of life. Here's what I find outrageous. There has been five Democratic debates. The media has not asked them a single question on abortion. And on abortion, the Democrats are extremists. Why doesn't the media ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that all abortions should be legal? Even on the due date of that unborn child. Why don't they ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that partial-birth abortion, which is a gruesome procedure that has been outlawed in this country, she thinks that's a fundamental right? They are the extremists when it comes to the issue of abortion and I can't wait to expose them in a general election."

He went to bat for veterans when the ACLU said there's there's a cross out in the middle of the desert the you have to tear down.

,"Increasingly, America is under attack. But the weapon of choice is not nuclear missiles. It's cyber attacks. And they're not just coming from our adversaries like Russia, China and North Korea. The attacks are also from an enemy that has taken an oath to destroy us. Now, the most troubling news of all. It's been exposed America's own Secretary of State sent thousands of sensitive, classified emails through a personal, unsecured account. And it's placed America in even greater peril in an already dangerous world. If Hillary Clinton has created this type of disaster as our Secretary of State, how could we ever feel safe with her as our Commander-in-Chief."
,"We left our house at nine o'clock this morning cause we wanted to be the first ones in there, to be able to get the best seats, because we're ready for Hillary. There's that groundswell of support for a Hillary Clinton candidacy and I hope to see it in 2016. When I supported Obama in 2008, I was super excited and now it's the same feeling. She would make an awesome President. If Hillary won, it's a giant step forward for our country. Her Secretary of State experience will give her that much of a leg up on anybody else. There's a a a just a feeling of excitement about the possibilities of a Hillary Clinton candidacy. We're so excited. We are so ready for Hillary to run. Hillary. Hillary. Hello Iowa. You're here because something or someone inspired you to get off the sideline. It's time we get somebody in there that's gonna work for the working middle-class people and I think Hillary's the one for the job. She's just an amazing woman and she shows that we can do this too. We aren't just something in the background. You can do this. No matter who you are or where you come, if you work hard and you play by the rules, you deserve the opportunity, the same opportunity as anyone else. That's what America has always done and it's time to summon that spirit again. We're first-time voters and we're ready for Hillary. I'm ready. I'm ready. We're ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I am ready. I'm ready for Hillary. So use the enthusiasm that Iowa is so well-known for. It's time to heed the push of our values and the pull of our future.

As we gather here today in this historic, magnificent building, the 50th woman to leave this Earth is orbiting overhead.

I have two sons, Solomon and Khalil, and like so many of you, I worry about what the future is going to look like for them. My kids, your kids and the next generation. These are reasons enough for Washington to put politics aside and to find real solutions to the rapidly growing threat of climate change. We have experienced devastating floods right here in Iowa that are directly connected to climate change. Politicians talk about an all of the above approach to energy. But that's all it is. It's talk. It's time for action. And as your representative, I will make our environment a top priority. I support the President's updated clean power plan. I'll work with colleagues across the aisle to invest in clean energy technologies like solar, wind and biofuels, while investing in new technologies. I'll vote to extend the solar energy tax credit and the wind energy tax credit. That means clean air and water for our kids, and good paying jobs for our citizens. And, I'll protect Iowa's renewable economy by supporting the Renewable Fuel Standard. I'm Desmund Adams and I approved this message because we can do better when it comes to our environment."

,"Hi. I'm Desmund Adams and I am running for United States Congress in the 3rd Congressional District. I'd like to take a moment to introduce myself. I have a beautiful wife Shondalay and two amazing sons, Khalil and Solomon. But my story begins as a high school dropout who did not appreciate education, but I have an incredible mother who does. I ended up earning a GED from Job Corps and I went on to earn a bachelor's of science and education from Drake University. And I graduated from Drake University Law School. And I had the distinct honor and privilege of having a clerk internship for the former Chief Justice of the Iowa Supreme Court, Louis Lavorato. I had a successful business career where I earned an award for my business from the Greater Des Moines Partnership. So you might ask, Desmund why do you want to run for United States Congress? I believe that we have intellectually disingenuous leaders today. Leaders that kick the issues down the street like a can. They don't address it. They don't address issues for people. I understand the complexities of Iowa and I understand the diversity within this district. I care about you. I care about my sons. I care about your children and the next generation. I ask you to visit my website DesmundAdams.com so that you can learn about the issues that I'm addressing that impact Iowa and our great nation. It's not about them. It's not about me. It's about we. Thank you for your time."
,"America doesn't need more Washington deals. And it is a good deal. A deal that meets our core objectives. We've paid for too many already. Done deal. What exactly is in this deal? Pop culture politicians got us into this mess. We need a principled, conservative fighter to get us out. Only one candidate fought the President's disastrous health care deal. This is, right now, and the continuing resolution, our best opportunity, and it may well be our last opportunity, to defund it. Only one candidate single-handedly stopped his own party's bad deal on amnesty. Republicans seemed to be on the verge of passing reforms that included a pathway to citizenship. That is, until Cruz blasted it as amnesty. Only one conservative is the candidate you can trust to stand on principle and fight for our values. Cruz, as you know, is somebody who is the keeper of conservative principles. On February 9th, vote for the conservative you can trust. I'm Ted Cruz and I approved this message."
,"Poll after poll shows that in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton is far and away the front-runner in the Democratic field. Been, has been for a while now. The other poll involves the Democrats, and Hillary Clinton, and she is doing remarkably well even though she has. A decisive win too for Bernie Sanders on the Democratic side. The Vermont senator scoring big over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Bernie Sanders. His first poll, 13% in New Hampshire. Hillary Clinton, 69% in New Hampshire. A horrible night for the Democratic establishment. They quite frankly, they are trying to spin this loss at just another contest, but of course we know this is so much more than that. This is New Hampshire. The state that she won 8 years ago. That delivered Bill Clinton to the White House in 1992. This. Is this normal? Is this a normal thing that campaigns do? This seemed. No. This shocked me when we go this tonight. No. This is pretty shocking, because it is a three-page memo from the campaign manager defensively explaining how they can come back and win the nomination in March. But this is a moral blow to their campaign. This is a reset for their campaign."
,"Look, I got the Trump action figure. No way, that's huge. What does he do? He pretends to be Republican. I like bailouts for the banks. Too big to fail. I gave money to Pelosi, Reid and Anthony Weiner. Hey Hilary, I'll give you money to be my friend. Check out my house, Mr. Trump. That's a lousy house. I'm gonna take your house with eminent domain and park my limos there. Eminent domain. We wouldn't tolerate these values in our children. Why would we want them in a president? Eminent domain."

,"Do you regret your vote for the Assault Weapons Ban in '94? Nah, you know going back and regretting. I voted for an assault weapons ban. When you're a governor for eight years, you got a record, and here's mine. I earned an A-plus rating from the NRA. Florida's pro-gun laws have been the model for other states. You worked to expand Medicaid, you worked with President Obama. To give President Obama bipartisan cover on Obamacare. Your answer. Yeah. One governor expanded Medicaid and the other did too. Well I think that was wrong. I don't think we should be expanding a broken insurance system that will cost hundreds of billions of dollars, when it's dramatically expanded as is. We're gonna make the Pentagon a triangle. I'm thrilled. I spent a whole career trying to rein in defense spending. We need to rebuild the military. As President of the United States, I will be a Commander-in-Chief that will have the back of the military. The Cato Institute gave you a D on its government's report card last year, noting that the budget grew 13.6 percent in 2014. 1.3 million jobs, 4.4 percent growth, eight balanced budgets. That is a conservative record. I did cut taxes every year. When I left there were $9 billion in reserves. I know we can fix this because I've done it."

Not just why are we going to win, but when we get there, what are we going to do? It is not enough to be angry. You have a right to be angry, but anger is not a plan. First thing I'm going to do is take the oath of office.

That's why I introduced legislation to give flex-time to working moms and working parents, because we need to give them opportunity to continue to work, and and also to take care of their families. I think that when New Hampshire families are strong and healthy, then New Hampshire is better and stronger for it."
,"ISIS has their sights on America, declaring war in 2012. But during a recent interview, Maggie Hassan clumsily proclaimed that ISIS declared war on us just last month.

Kelly Ayotte understands the terror threat. Kelly in a recent radio interview. They declared war on us in 2012. We've seen our American citizens that have been beheaded and killed from ISIS well before this. We saw that they attempted an attack on our homeland in Texas.

I warned that these arms might end up in the hands of jihadists and that one day we might be forced to go back to fight against our own weapons. Within a year that prediction came true.

Our constitution won't allow for this kind of unilateral action. I'm gonna have to act alone. Have to act alone. Have to act alone. On health care. President said to us I'm gonna ask myself one question. How do you think we do? Why not? All of these crazy regulations that President Obama is putting forward, we don't even get a vote. He has been collecting your phone records without our permission. We are of less value than the most minor of bureaucrats.

,"What do you list as Marco Rubio's top accomplishment that made you decide to endorse him? I guess it's hard to say there are accomplishments. I'll ask him more time. List one accomplishment that Marco Rubio has achieved in four years in the United States Senate. Jeb Bush ran Florida. Marco Rubio, finish the sentence. Well I mean I would just say that there's a guy who's been able to number one. Bottom line is he didn't get accomplishments done, neither did President Obama. You vetoed $2 billion in spending, cut taxes by $19 billion, 1.3 million jobs, 4.4 percent growth, eight balanced budgets. That is a conservative record. I was a reform-minded conservative. I did cut taxes every year. I balanced budgets every year. When I left there were $9 billion in reserves. We reduced the state government workforce by 13,000. And my record of government, I think, shows the path of what could happen in Washington D.C."
,"You have an executive or a former executive of a state, why is that person not in a better position than you are. The presidency of the United States is a unique office. It's not like being a senator, but it's not like being a governor either. I guess the question is, have you been in a position where you've had to make tough calls, where there are real consequences and where do you get that strength from when you, if you were to make the presidency, where you would be in those kind of decisions all day long, multiple times? Look, it is true that the presidency is not like being a U.S. senator, but it's also not like being a governor. So let me ask you, what do you consider your biggest legislative accomplishment? Well first let me say that the most important job of President is Commander-in-Chief. Being President is not like being a senator, but it's not like being a governor either."
,"When there are important votes, especially those where I can be a decisive voice, I'm gonna be there. But I'm also running for President cause I want these votes to matter again. I'm running for President so that the votes they take in the Senate are actually meaningful again. A lot of these votes won't mean anything. They're not gonna pass. And even if they did, the President would veto it. Because these votes they're taking in Washington, they don't count. We vote to repeal Obamacare, but unless you have a President that will sign it, it's not gonna matter."
,"We can do this. But it requires someone with a proven record. It requires someone who's willing to run to the fire to try to take it out. And to beat Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, someone with a proven record is a lot better than someone who's been talking about stuff. I've had 32 years in the private sector. Eight years turning government systems upside down. I know how to do this. Leaders operate by creating strategies and then having the dogged determination to stick with it. I won't cut and run when the going gets tough. I think it's okay actually to have detailed plans. You make the difference. You have the say. And I have total confidence that the voters of New Hampshire won't let our country down. And on next Tuesday, we're gonna surprise the world."

,"After securing the border? Well first, not just secure the border. People have to have confidence that you're doing, that you've done it. In essence, I do not believe, having worked on this issue now for a long time, including just personally having come from the background I come from, that the American people are going to support anything on immigration until first they believe that illegal immigration is truly under control. That means finishing a wall and fencing, new border patrol agents, an entry-exit tracking system, and e-verify. Only after that's in place and that's working can we go to the American people, and see what they are willing to support. I think. The only way forward on immigration, and I know this having gone through this process. The only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control and prove to people. And it's not even enough to pass a bill that secures the border. You have to do it first. And only after you've done it, will the American people support you doing anything else. When I'm President. When I'm the nominee. We're gonna help. We're gonna keep our majority in the House and Senate, and we're gonna pass, first and foremost, immigration laws that secure our border. And until that is in place, we're not gonna be able to do anything else. That's the lesson of the last ten years. The American people. We do not have the political support to do it all at once. They do not trust the federal government to enforce immigration laws and as a result, the key that unlocks the door to be able to make progress on immigration, is to bring illegal immigration under control. And we will do that when I am President."

,"Hello. This is Congressman Jeff Duncan and I'm excited to announce that I'm endorsing Ted Cruz for President. I know that when Ted says he's gonna do something, he does it. Ted isn't a campaign conservative. He's a proven conservative who has led so many critical fights, ranging from defense of our traditional values and for our religious liberties, to fighting runaway government spending, to battling against Obamacare. When we needed Ted Cruz, he was there for us. It is critical that we as conservatives unite behind someone like Ted, who shares our values. He's a conservative who can beat Hillary Clinton this fall. You see, if we don't nominate a conservative who can contrast with Hillary on issues like amnesty, marriage or health care, we're likely to lose the White House. Again. Here in South Carolina, we have the opportunity to support Ted Cruz, a principled conservative who shares our South Carolina values. I enthusiastically endorse Ted Cruz for President and I'm asking each of you to join me by going to TedCruz.org and signing up to join the team today."
,"Today I was barnstorming out through northwest Iowa and there were a lot of people who for the very first time kind of zeroed in on the decision they had to make, and they did it around that last forum.

I want you to hold strong not only to lift up a new leader and a new President, I want you to hold strong for that country you carry in your heart. I want you to hold strong for that third grade boy or girl who's only gonna be in third grade once. I want you to hold strong for that dreamer who goes to school and goes to work everyday, worried about whether she'll come home and find her parents have been deported. We are all in this together. We are a good. We are a kind. We are a generous people. And we have only need to lift up a new leader to move our country forward and that's what you're gonna do come Monday night here in Iowa."

I think that he is, that if the Democrats are more scared of anybody, they're scared of Marco Rubio. He is young, charismatic, optimistic. I think Rubio is gonna be tough. You've only got one candidate that me and my friends would vote for. Rubio. I'm terrified of Rubio. I do not want him to win. That's the one we don't want. He comes in with Florida. He comes in with the Latino connection. He comes in with the young thing. He's so different from Hillary Clinton. You start stacking up three days, back to back, and it gets harder, but in the middle of something we love doing. Like if you're excited, you got adrenaline going, you love what you're doing, you're engaging with people, being with voters, campaigning, talking about what you believe in passionately and with a sense of urgency because you realize we're closer to this election. This is going to be a turning point for America. I think that's what drives me. The idea that we're gonna have a real chance to finally get this country moving in the right direction."

,"Well hello everyone. This is Dr. James Dobson. As private citizens, my wife Shirley and I urge you to support Ted Cruz for President. Other Republicans are certainly worthy of consideration, but at this point it looks like a vote for anyone other than Ted Cruz is a vote for Donald Trump. For people of faith who care about religious liberty, life, and marriage, it's time for us to rally around Ted Cruz. Senator Cruz has the intelligence, the courage, the grasp of domestic and world affairs, and the solid foundation of faith and family to stand firmly in support of our conservative values.

,"Hi I'm George Pataki. I was honored to lead the people of New York State as governor for over a decade. I brought to that job the values I learned growing up on a small family farm in the Hudson Valley; The values of hard work, family, faith and community. But mostly what I brought was a belief in America _ that tomorrow would always be better _ and that as a free people we could accomplish anything. Today, too many Americans feel their children's future won't be as bright as their own. They are frightened by the prospect of radical Islam attacking us here. And frightened by a government in Washington that grows more and more powerful. If we're truly going to make America great again - we need to elect a president who will do three things; confront and defeat radical Islam, shrink the size and power of Washington and unite us again in our belief in this great country. As Governor on September 11th, yes I saw unspeakable horror, but I also saw Americans united as never before, and what Americans can do when we stand shoulder to shoulder. On that day and the days that followed we weren't black or white, rich or poor, Republican or democrat - we were just Americans. We need to recapture that spirit. Because I know when we stand together - we can accomplish anything. While tonight is the end of my journey for the White House as I suspend my campaign for president, I am confident we can elect the right person. Someone who will bring us together and who understands that politicians including the president must be the people's servant and not their master. I know the best of America is still ahead of us. Happy New Year, may God bless you and may God bless the United States of America. I'm George Pataki and I approve this message."

,There's a lot of people that talked up. I'm the only one who stood up to a hundred thousand protesters. Stood up to the big union bosses. I'll stand up to Washington regardless of party and fight for the American people. Unintimidated. I am not intimidated by you sir or anyone else out there. I will fight for the American people over and over and over and over again. We will not back down. We will do what is necessary.
,"On a cold, windswept day, Scott Walker solemnly took the oath of office. His state faced a staggering deficit. Unemployment lines were long. So he took big, bold action. The left erupted. They stormed the capital. But Scott Walker stood his ground. Unintimidated. They even threatened his family. But he stood firm and he won. The battle left the big government special interests crippled. But the real winners. Children. Taxpayers. Seniors. He told people who he was, what he believed, what he was gonna do and he got elected. Then he did it. And his reforms are working. Unable to make him cave, the left tried to recall him. They threw everything at him. And he beat them again. Scott Walker remains Wisconsin's Governor. Scott Walker routed the recall. It wasn't even close. Why'd he win? He balanced the budget. He lowered taxes. He's turning our economy around, reforming our schools. Courage is on the ballot. What the left is trying to do is send a signal to any other reformer like Scott Walker. Don't dare try this cause we'll get you next. And the left couldn't believe it. To say that I'm shocked and stunned is pretty much an understatement. We all thought it was going to be a long night. I had chocolate for dinner. Maybe the recall of Governor Scott Walker would be actually be decided in a matter of 49 minutes. This election tonight may have just been one recall election for one governor seat. What happens as a result of this could be the biggest politics story of all."
,"For too long, they've said we'd have to compromise our principles to win. Scott Walker showed the path to victory is to run on our principles. Conservative. Bold. Decisive. He balanced budgets, cut taxes, beat the special interests, improved education, created jobs, and showed how to fight and win. American needs new, fresh leadership. Big, bold ideas from outside of Washington. Actually get things done. In Wisconsin, we didn't nibble around the edges. We enacted big, bold reforms. It took power out of the hands of the big government special-interests and gave it to the hardworking taxpayers. People's lives are better because of if. We fought and we won. In the Republican field, there are some who are good fighters, but they haven't won those battles. There are others who've won elections but haven't consistently taken on the big fights. We've showed you can do both. Now I'm running for President to fight and win for the American people. Not sacrificing our principles, we won three elections in four years in a blue state. We did it by leading. Now we need to do the same thing for America. It's not too late. We can make our country great again. Join our cause. Help us fight and win for America."
,"Ted Cruz says Donald Trump has boatloads of liberal positions. Donald Trump says Ted Cruz can't beat the Democrats. Well they're both right.

,"And I will defend a woman's right to choose and Planned Parenthood. And Planned Parenthood. This video from Planned Parenthood has made national news and their so-called doctor is on there celebrating how she crushes the body parts of fetuses. Your take on how this video changes the debate. Unlike Hillary Clinton, who has a radical position in terms of support for Planned Parenthood, I defunded Planned Parenthood more than four years ago, long before any of these videos came out. In our state, we we took the money, we defunded Planned Parenthood and we put it into other entities. In many cases, we put it in the county public health services. So there are better, non-controversial ways to do that, that can still protect and provide for women's health. That's why when people talk about a pro-life record in this race, I've actually done it. Defunded Planned Parenthood. Passed pro-life legislation. But this video is one more example of why defunding them is so important."
,"Real reform sometimes looks like this. Governor Scott Walker's plan to limit the state unions is reshaping the state. But it also looks like this. A local school district has reported a surplus, with smaller class sizes too. Workers are now embracing performance pay. Overtime costs are down 30 percent. A balanced budget has now been signed by Governor Walker. Three billion in taxpayer savings. Those from Washington won't fix Washington. Join Scott Walker today."
,"New revelations of a secret side agreement in the Iran nuclear deal. This is a deal which we cannot lock our country into. One thing that I won't do is to say, as a candidate, I'm gonna tear up the agreement on the first day. I refuse to live with a deal that threatens our safety and that of our closest allies. See, unlike others, I don't need months or years to mull this over. If Congress fails to stop the nuclear deal, I will terminate it on day one."
,"If you ever see my good friend Rick Perry or actually even my brother George W., tell them that we created more jobs than Texas during those eight years. When you got blue skies and the wind behind your back, as the early 2000s, the late 90's were in Florida, you know it was pretty easy to create jobs down there. But the real, I think the real challenge and the real record is, look at who created jobs when the Great Recession of 2008 forward was occurring and Texas created 1.5 million jobs from the end of 07 through 2014, while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs. Now I'll share with you Bill, that I think that that's what Americans want to look for. Tell me who can perform when things are rough and tough. Boom."
,"With 15 years of executive experience as Maryland's governor, I have learned how to be a very effective leader. I have learned how to get things done. I am clear about my principles. I know where I stand. We passed the living wage. We raised the minimum wage. We froze college tuition for four years in a row and these were actions not words. As governor I've made it easier and not harder for workers to bargain collectively for better wages for all Americans. Actions not words. And instead of cutting public education funding as governor, I actually increased funding for public education by 37% and memo to Governor Branstad, we made our public schools the best public schools in America five years in a row. Actions not words. And along the way, I brought people together to pass the DREAM Act, to pass marriage equality and to pass the most comprehensive gun safety legislation in the United States, with universal background checks and a ban on combat assault weapon sales. Actions not words."
,"This epidemic of gun violence knows no boundaries, knows no limits of any kind and when this happens, people are quick to say that they offer their thoughts and prayers. That's not enough. How many people have to die before we actually act. The federal government shouldn't be involved in in gun laws. If laws stopped murderers, there wouldn't be murderers in the first place. I don't think any President can stop mass shootings. Look, stuff happens. Got to get the political will to do everything we can to keep people safe. I know there is a way to have sensible gun control measures that help prevent violence, prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands, and save lives. And I'm committed to doing everything I can to achieve that."
,"So that we can begin to practice what many of us preach, about transparency and openness. I believe that marriage is not just a bond, but a sacred bond between a man and a woman. I and my senior colleague from New York and my colleagues from California and others, are opposing the ethanol mandate that is included in this bill. Livelihoods of tens of thousands more who depend on Wall Street's economy are threatened as well. New York City and New York State, already facing serious economic and fiscal challenges, will now be forced to contend with a battered Wall Street, the lifeblood of our state's economy. It is with conviction that I support this resolution as being in the best interests of our nation. A vote for it is not a vote to rush to war. It is a vote that puts awesome responsibility in the hands of our President and we say to him use these powers wisely and as a last resort. And it is a vote that says clearly to Saddam Hussein, this is your last chance to disarm or be disarmed."
,"His biggest proposal thus far: a massive tax cut that could drive up the debt by as much as four trillion dollars over a decade. Rubio says he believes that the best way to spark growth and to increase wages, is to reduce the tax burden on businesses the wealthy and investors. Marco Rubio right at the end let slip that he wants to have no taxes at all on investment income. Does Jeb Bush need a three million tax cut? So of course tax cuts for everybody is going to generate more for people that are paying a lot more. That's just the way it is. Donald Trump fashions himself a new kind of politician, but his tax plan follows the same supply-side economic theory Republicans have embraced since the early nineteen-eighties. The idea is to cut tax rates on the wealthy. Simplify the code to generate economic growth. It is a fraud, a total fraud. Fraud. He's talking about giving tax cuts to the middle class and helping the working poor. It's crumbs for them and caviar for the rich. For thirty-five years, Republicans have argued that if we give more wealth to those at the top by cutting their taxes and letting big corporations write their own rules, it will trickle down. It will trickle down to everyone else, yet every time they have a chance to try that approach, it explodes the National Debt, concentrates wealth even more, and does practically nothing to help hard-working Americans."
,"A true conservative outsider who successfully took the fight to liberal Democrats in a blue state. Chris Christie. The guts to stand up to Congress and special interests, and not back down. I've proven that you can stand up and fight the most powerful special interests. With Democrats fighting Chris Christie's every move, he did what others only talk about it. He defunded Planned Parenthood. Vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history. Cut 800 programs and billions in spending. Beat the unions to reform teacher tenure. You want a president with the guts to stop the liberals ruining America. Who cares about you and has your back. A Christie presidency won't be about me. It will be about you. You play by the rules. You pay the taxes. You do the hard things to raise your family. This President has stripped away their trust in their faith and their belief. He's stolen that from us and when I'm President, I'm gonna take it back. America Leads is responsible for the content of this advertising.

,"We might have seen a hint today of what's to come tomorrow. Kasich supporters giving him a big send off in Columbus this afternoon. Ohio Governor John Kasich declaring he's going to call out other candidates on their rhetoric. I've about had it with these people and let me tell you why. We got one candidate that says that we ought to abolish Medicaid and Medicare. We got one person saying we ought to have a 10 percent flat tax. We got one guy that says we ought to take ten or eleven million people, we're gonna pick them up and take them to the border, and scream at them to get out of our country. One of the candidates says he's known as Veto Corleone. He's so proud of the fact that he vetoes everything. You know what vetoes are? Vetoes are a sign you can't get what you want. That's just, I mean, that's just crazy. A couple hundred supporters were on hand to hear a fired-up John Kasich, who was ready to challenge the ideas of the frontrunners and the better known GOP candidates. What has happened to our party? What has happened to the conservative movement? I am sick and tired of listening to this nonsense and I'm gonna have to call it like it is. We better be careful that we don't turn this country over to somebody who's not capable of running it, because if we turn this country. If we turn this country over to somebody with wild ideas, that think they can scream and bluster or operate their way to success, it's my kids that are gonna be at risk and your kids and your grandchildren and all of us. We need a leader that has vision. A leader that has courage. A leader that has a backbone. And a leader that has faith in a higher power, namely the lord himself. So thank you.

,"We live in an economy in which the most valuable retailer in America, Amazon, they don't own a single store. The largest transportation company, Uber, doesn't even own vehicles. But if we embrace the new American economy, the accomplishments that our people will make will astonish the world. And our children and theirs will live in a new American century."
,"It's an interesting question. That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too. Why don't you wait in line? Wait for what? This country's running out of time. We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years. Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck. They're working as hard as they ever have. Everything costs more and they haven't had a raise in decades. You have small businesses in America that are struggling for the first time in 35 years. We have more businesses closing than starting. I'm not worried about my finances. I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more. We're all talking about reforms for future generations. Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries. My mother's on Medicare and Social Security. I'm against anything that's bad for my mother. The Democrats have the ultimate super PAC. They're called the mainstream media, who every single day. And I'll tell you why. Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee. She admitted she had sent emails to her family saying hey this attack in Benghazi was caused by Al-Qaeda like elements. She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video and yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign. It was the week she got exposed as a liar. You know, America doesn't owe me anything. I have a debt to America I'll never repay. This isn't just the country I was born in. This is the nation that literally changed the history of my family. My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did. We call that the American Dream. Although it's built on a universal dream of a better life, the fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special. But now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away, and we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch. And that's why I'm running for president. Because we can't just save the American dream, we can expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before."
,"Look, I'm on a lot of covers. I think maybe more than almost any supermodel. I think more than any supermodel. We're rounding them up in a very humane way. In a very nice way. And they're gonna be happy because they want Donald Trump. The people want him. He is number one in the polls and it's not an accident. It's not a mistake. For everyone who's a valedictorian, there's another hundred out there that, they weigh a hundred and thirty pounds, and they've got calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. Back in my days, we used Bayer Aspirin for contraceptives. The gals put it between their knees and it wasn't that costly. I'm not a witch. I'm nothing you've heard. I don't know that all of you are Latinos. Some of you look a little more Asian to me. I had a mother last night. She told me that her little daughter took that. Took that vaccine. That injection and she suffered from mental retardation thereafter. Governor, do you regret using the term anchor babies yesterday on the radio? No, I didn't. I don't. I don't regret it. You don't regret it? No. You don't favor a rape and an incest law? I never said that and I have never advocated that. There is no war on women. There may be a war on what's inside of woman, but there is no war on women in this country. To me, it actually seems it's more a reflection of the Republican party right now. The more that Donald Trump takes off. This country is a hellhole."
,"Tonight you sit at home in your living room, frustrated that you play by the rules. You pay the taxes. You do the hard things to raise your family. Yet you feel like America's generosity is being taken advantage of. That the system is being gamed. And that you're turning out to fall further and further behind. One of the problems that I see is the fact that congress doesn't listen to us. They seem to once they get elected. They're off doing their own thing. If they had to shut down, everybody pays but them. Anything as a president you can do to get this corrected. What would you do if the government decided to shut down again? People seem to say a lot of things to get elected and then once they get to Washington, not only does it not happen, but sometimes the opposite happens. A Christie presidency won't be about me. It will be about you our presidency. It will be about enforcing the law, level the playing field for everybody and once again reward those folks who play by the rules. And think that justice means more than just a word, but it means a way of life"
,"A CBS News poll released yesterday has Dr. Carson 21% in second place GOP sweepstakes behind Donald Trump, who has 27%. Maybe that's why the far left continues to hammer the doctor. There's something about you that really annoys the secular progressives. What is that? Well I think it's the fact that I simply won't submit to their nonsense. How dare someone like me actually think for themselves. Yesterday, I was at a book signing in Tennessee and we were having a little press conference, and one of these people said are the controversial things that you're saying hurting you? And I said, well first of all they're only controversial to you, the left wing media, because you take them out of context and you try to reinterpret them. The the left wing does have standard practice for black people and you're not supposed to wander away from that, or you're an uncle tom. You're a traitor. You're all kinds of names that they call you. I, I find it rather amusing and I think a lot of Americans find it rather amusing too. They know they're going to do this. People have been saying this for months. They're going to come after you with everything they can possibly can. They're gonna be digging through everything. They're gonna try to reinterpret everything. They're desperate."
,"I'm back. I'm running for President. It's season two and the debate wait is over. This fall, tune into likable enough. Well can I just point out that in the last several debates I seem to get the first question all the time and i don't mind. Maybe we should ask Barack if he is comfortable and needs another pillow. Did she do that? I don't think based on my 35 years of fighting for what I believe in anybody seriously believes I'm gonna be influenced by a lobbyist or a particular interest group. Now you know. Alright, alright. I've been waiting for this. Remember what happened when we mixed last season's characters with a Clinton? Hilarity. No, no, no you said. You said yes. No, you thought it made sense to do it. No I didn't Chris. But unless I missed something, Senator Clinton said two different things in the course of about two minutes. I can't tell whether she was for it or against it. Part of leadership is not just looking backwards and saying what's popular. And this season, the debate stage is full of a whole new cast you'll come to love. The socialist, guitar guy, Lincoln Chafee and many, many more. The critics have spoken. Tune in. I don't think I'm that bad. You're likable enough. This Tuesday, don't miss likable enough"

,"We're on 2nd Street and Hope, the street I lived on and about a block from my house. This is the fire station, this is a where my dad worked. Hope was a great little town to grow up in. It was a place where people knew each other, cared about each other, helped each other. My grandmother's house was here, right on the train tracks like my house was. Clinton boyhood home right here, but we won't spend a lot of time here. I think the most important value I learned as a kid growing up in a little town like Hope, Arkansas was there's a difference between right and wrong. There's a difference between good and evil. I hope I never forget where I come from. I hope I never forget this porch. I hope I never forget what it's like to live in a neighborhood where neighbors know each other and care about each other. Where people have to work hard just to be able to put food on their table, clothes on their kids, back pay the rent on a rent house like the one I lived in. There's a lot more of America who's living like I grew up living than will ever live in a white house or a governor's mansion.

We refuse to allow our country and this generation of leaders to slow or reverse America's long march toward a more perfect union.

,"Entitlement reforms is about saying if you want to invest in a greater national defense. If you want to invest in research and development and education well then you can spend 71 percent on entitlements. When Jack Kennedy was President, we spent 26 percent on entitlements. There's just so much money that we can borrow from the Chinese and print at the Fed. Social security and Medicare are about making sure that our elderly don't grow old in poverty. On social security, I would raise the retirement age two years, phased in over the next 25 years. Second, I would means-test social security, and so for anybody who makes two hundred thousand dollars a year or more in retirement income, income not assets. That means you've probably got 4 or 5 million bucks put aside. We should also means-test Medicare. We should increase eligibility age again for Medicare two years, phase in over 25, and for folks who make two hundred thousand dollars a year or more in retirement income, we should only subsidize their medicare premiums 10 percent rather than the 75 percent we subsidize their premiums now. Medicaid we should go to a per capita grant to each state. You get more poor people in your state in a particular year, you get more money. You get less, you get less. That will save hundreds of billions dollars over the next ten years.

I think I'm probably the most transparent person in public life.
,"Imagine a leader who understands us. Our hopes, our concerns. The courage to speak directly, honestly. Tell it like it is. Chris Christie. Unafraid to lead a belief in American exceptionalism and resolve to overcome any challenge. A blue state governor who balanced every budget, cut taxes, made government smaller. A leader unafraid to defend our conservative principles, while bringing people together to solve problems and get results. When tragedy struck, he led. He cared. He delivered. In town hall gatherings, Chris Christie is listening to us, adopting strong positions historically untouched and ignored by others. Entitlement reform, tax reform. That's a model for economic revival. Restoring America's strength and respect in a dangerous world. A leader unafraid to speak directly, honestly and tell it like it is. Chris Christie. Unafraid to lead."
,"A lot of people want these progressive things to happen and they don't understand that Martin O'Malley is the one who can get that stuff done. This means good jobs, higher minimum wage, and wage policies that allow families to earn more as they work harder and harder."
,"I believe that marriage is not just a bond, but a sacred bond between a man and a woman. I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman. For me as a Christian, it's also a sacred union. You know God's in in the mix."
,"I don't know if any of you have had a terrible illness and you know how hard that is, and then you know what the impact that is on the family trying to afford to give the best care that can possibly be provided. I have a chronic lung disease called cystic fibrosis, so when she had reached out it was a really personal connection, like I'm here, I hear what you're saying to me, I will do my best. No child, no adult should go without quality, affordable health care, and my pledge as it has been for twenty-five years is I will do everything I can to make that possible. We've got to defend the Affordable Care Act."
,Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill and Bernie Sanders voted to give gun manufacturers protection from victim lawsuits. The NRA even paid for ads attacking a Sanders opponent. Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns.
,"When I was a young pastor in my twenties, I stood in front of what had been an all white church. This was well over thirty years ago and I welcomed the first African-American member to that church. I had death threats. There were people who said they would leave the church, but instead I held my ground. I said he goes, I go. Government can do some things, but only God can change people's hearts. Government can put us in the same classrooms, but government can't make classmates go home and be friends when school is out. Government can make sure that the doors to every public building are open to everyone. Government can ensure that we share schools and streets and lunch counters and buses and elevators and theaters, but let us never forget that only God can give us the power to love each other and respect each other and to share life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
,"I think we're all united by certain aspirations. We want access to opportunity. We want good schools for our kids. We want to live in safe neighborhoods. We wanna live in cities and states where housing and college, and everyday expenses, are affordable. We want to all experience the American Dream. America has never been perfect. No country composed of imperfect beings ever could be. But there is no country that has achieved more than the United States of America, and with new leadership and with durable reforms, America can be stronger, more prosperous than it's ever been before. America can be this incredibly exceptional place for ourselves, for our children and for our children's children. Thank you and God bless you."
,"This is a dangerous, dangerous world right now. This President is allowing Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world, to have a glide path towards a nuclear weapon. A strong American military is not built to wage war, it is built to prevent war. I am the only candidate who has actually been responsible for fighting terrorism, and has prosecuted terrorists and put them in jail, and if I become President, we're going to protect the homeland, not lower our defenses against them."
,"Hey, I'm Rand Paul and I'm trying to kill the tax code, all 70,000 pages of it. You want to know more about my plan to have a one-page tax code, a one page tax return, a flat tax of 14.5 %? Go to RandPaul.com and you can learn more about it."
,"I'm gonna campaign in places where Republicans haven't been seen in awhile. I know that's kind of unusual. We used to do it with great regularity. When we won elections, we won because we had an uplifting message, a hopeful optimistic message. Not one that says how bad things are, but how good things can be if we fix the things that are broken today. I believe we need that kind of leadership right now, and we need to go share that joy and love of country all across this country. That will be my mission. Not to disrespect anybody, but to go out and campaign hard with passion and conviction, and share my love and joy for this greatest country on the face of the earth. Thank you all very much and thank you for hosting us."
,"While Hillary was evolving on marriage equality, he was legislating on it. Gay, lesbian and transgender, and straight Americans. All of us are included. All of us are needed. There is no such thing as a spare American."
,"We don't have a skin problem in America, we have a sin problem in America. That is the root and the heart and the cause of racial strife and it cannot be reconciled by the government stepping in and making pronouncements. There is a prescription. Second chronicles 7:14. If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways. Those are the conditions. Then he says he will hear from heaven. He will forgive our sins and he will heal our land. I think people forget God will heal this land, but he won't do it if we don't meet the conditions for him to heal it."
,"I'm running for President of the United States and I need your help Iowa. There is no challenge that our nation faces that cannot be overcome so long as we hold strong to our American values, realize that we need each other, that we're all in this together and we have to help each other if we're going to succeed. And so Iowa, I challenge you to do what you have always done best. That is, to go to your own caucus, hold strong, and bring forward a new leader who can heal the divisions in our country and move us forward. I need your help. I want your vote. Thanks very, very much."
,"In the face of radical Islam, some like Rand Paul would continue America's retreat, while Rick Santorum continues to call for a stronger national defense. On education, Mike Huckabee supported Common Core, something Rick Santorum has always stood against. And to protect working families, it's Rick Santorum with a plan to end the immigration crisis. Rick Santorum, the one conservative conservatives can trust. Working Again PAC is responsible for the content of this advertising."
,"Planned Parenthood takes over a half a billion tax dollars every year. They perform abortions and sell baby body parts. Rand Paul is taking action. As a pro-life doctor, Rand Paul cared for premature babies to save their sight. As a conservative leader, Rand is forcing this week to end taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood. Standing for life from day one, Dr. Rand Paul for President. I'm Rand Paul I approve this message."
,I'm proud to stand with Planned Parenthood. I'll never stop fighting to protect the ability and right.
,"Mr. Trump's language is divisive. I want to win. We're not going to win by doing what Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton do each and every day. Dividing the country, creating a grievance kind of environment. We're gonna win when we unite people with a hopeful, optimistic message. I have that message because I was a governor of a state that saw people lifted up because we had high sustained economic growth. Our economy grew at double the rate of the nation. We created 1.3 million jobs. We led the nation seven out of those eight years. We were only one of two states that went to AAA bond rating. I cut taxes 19 billion dollars. If you do that and apply conservative principles the right way, you create an environment where everybody rises up. That's how we're gonna win."
,"Our children. Their future. Nothing is more important. I'm Ben Carson. People ask why run for President? Because our children face a very harsh future. Unsustainable debt. Future generations will suffer. At ten million dollars a day for five thousand years, it still won't be repaid. Washington is broken. The political class broke it. Please join me for their sake. I'm Ben Carson and I approve this message."
,"People are so concerned about the future. The future for their children. The future for our nation. Well, the big message is that this country was designed around we the people of, for, and by the people, and that we need a government that actually understands that and doesn't think that it is the ruler of the people. I'm learning from crowds that they are hungry for some integrity, for some honesty and for some real solutions to the problems that ail us. Not so much interested in partisan bickering and wisecracks and denigration of other people, and that's perfect because that's exactly where I fit."
,"My name is Martin O'Malley. I am running for President and I need your help. Last year, Wall Street bonuses alone totaled twice what every American working at minimum wage earned combined. Can we all agree that every American family should have the option of sending their kids to earn a college degree debt-free? Then let's take the action to make debt-free college a reality. Generation Forward PAC is responsible for the content of this advertising."
,"Iowa knows best. It's always been that way. Some places, when stuff breaks you call a guy. Here, you just go fix it. Chores are shared. Martin O'Malley works like Iowans work. When you caucus, stand with Martin O'Malley. Stand up for new leadership for progressive action. For fixing it ourselves. Prove it's true. Iowa knows best. Generation Forward PAC is responsible for the content of this advertising."
,"You want somebody who believes in freedom. You wanna have somebody with some good ideas. Somebody who's not afraid to think outside the box. We need a guy like Rand Paul in the White House. We are in a terrible, terrible, terrible economy and Rand Paul's proposal is absolutely spectacular. You know we have a seventy thousand page tax code and I think it's chasing American jobs overseas. Chasing American companies overseas. It angers me to see mobs burning our flag and chanting death to America in countries that receive our foreign aid. I say it must end. I say not one penny more to these haters of America. Rand Paul values principle over party. He isn't afraid to stand up to the establishment when it comes to what is best for our country. You go back and ask Debbie Wasserman Schultz if she's okay with killing a seven pound baby that is just not yet born yet. You get an answer from Debbie and come back to me. I say the phone records of law abiding citizens is none of their damn business. Senator Paul. Senator Paul. Senator Paul. Senator Paul."
,"Her parents abandon her when she was just eight years old. She was mistreated but she never gave up and she taught me to do the same. My mom's life and what she went through are big reasons why standing up for kids and families became such a big part of my life. After law school, she could have gone to a big firm, but instead went to work for the Children's Defense Fund in Arkansas. She fought for school reform to change lives forever. Then as First Lady, she helped get health care for 8 million kids. You probably know the rest. The senator who made sure the heroes and families of 9/11 got the care they needed. The Secretary of State who joined the cabinet of the man who defeated her because when your President calls, you serve. And now a new title: grandma. I believe that when families are strong, America is strong. It's your time. I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message."
,"Progressive ideas are great. Progressive actions are better. Martin O'Malley's accomplishments as Governor of Maryland prove he's the leader who gets the big things done. Marriage equality. A higher minimum wage. The nation's toughest gun control laws. The nation's best schools five years in a row. No increases in college tuition. The DREAM act passed and death penalty repealed. Action, not just talk. Generation Forward PAC is responsible for the content of this advertising."
,"People should and do trust me trust me. We have a candidate here that was not being honest or candid about what she's done with her emails. Voters thinking that she's dishonest and not trustworthy. She's doing terribly in terms of people believing she is honest and trustworthy. Trust is really gonna hurt her in the long run. Again, let's take a deep breath here. I've never had a subpoena. We sent her a subpoena. Couldn't be more plain. The Honorable Hillary R. Clinton. I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. Classified information was transmitted on the private server that she ran out of her home. I did not send nor receive anything that was classified. The FBI is now looking into the private email system that Hillary Clinton used. Maybe the heat is getting to everybody. Despite her repeated past denials, the intelligence community's Inspector General now says two of her emails should have been classified top secret. That's one of the highest levels of classification. This is being blown up with no basis in law or in fact. The U.S. government, the Department of Justice has been asking for the server, has ordered her team to turn over her personal email server and thumb drive. Now that thumb drive is going to be held by the FBI itself. She didn't turn it over voluntarily. It's a dangerous new development for her. How do you have a private email server as Secretary of State and scrub it, and I'm gonna believe you and do you think the american public is that stupid?"
,"We used to call this city Mount Tallahassee because it was remote from the people, caught up in the subtle ways of a comfortable establishment. I was a governor who refused to go along with that establishment. I wasn't a member of the club and that made all the difference. We balanced our budget every year I was in office and increased our state's reserves by eight billion dollars. I vetoed more than 2,500 spending items totaling two billion dollars. Should I win this election you won't find me deferring to the ways of Mount Washington. The overspending. The over-reaching. The arrogance. The sheer incompetence of the city. We need a President willing to challenge the whole culture in our nation's capital and I mean to do it."
,"She's a fighter. She's a fighter for our families, for our kids; to make sure that we have a good future for those other Tom Harkin's that are out there running around someplace whose parents don't have very much, but who have dreams and who want to be a part of America, and America's future. So that's why I'm supporting Hillary Clinton for president. She has the experience; she has the values; she knows how to fight and she knows how to work with other people to get the job done"
,"When you see that you've got CEO's making 300 times what the average worker is making, you know the deck is stacked in favor of those at the top. I want it to be back where it was when I came of age, where my mom who never got to go to college could see her daughter go to law school. We need to have people believing that their work will be rewarded. So I'm going to do everything I can to try and get that deck reshuffled, so being middle class means something again. I'm Hillary Clinton, and I approve this message."
,"But look, the reality is you got big business interest in D.C. that don't want the border secure. They want amnesty. They pay for protesters. They try to silence free speech. I'm here to tell you we are going to stand up to the big business interests. You want freedom. If you love America, follow the laws, learn English, adopt our values and get to work. God bless y'all. Thank y'all very much."
,"I'm Martin O'Malley and I'm running for President to rebuild the American Dream. There are big ideas and there are those who achieve them. It's about actions, not words. That is why I've laid out 15 progressive goals to make our economy work again for all of us. Like making incomes and family earnings go up, not down. Insuring a debt-free college education for every family. And turning the threat of climate change into a clean energy future, with five million new American jobs. Join me to rebuild the truth of the American Dream we share."
,"I'm Martin O'Malley. If our country is going to work again for all Americans, we need new ideas and bold approaches. We need to get things done.

I'm winning in all the states. You know you make a choice to win and you win. I'm winning everywhere. Wow, winning. I'm bi-winning. I win here and I win there. Now what."
,"I did not send classified material, and I did not receive any material that was marked or designated classified so that's, that's all I can say. Did you try to wipe the whole server?

,"I mean, how are you gonna run for President and you're gonna say this is what I saw in the video, when everyone can look at the video and say it doesn't exist. Anyone who has watched this video tape, I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes. A fully formed fetus on the table. Its heart beating. Its legs kicking. While someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain. That the heart actually is still beating. Here's a stomach, heart, kidney and adrenal. We're gonna harvest the brains. I was thinking no I don't want to do this. This is about the character of our nation, and if we will not stand up and force President Obama to veto this bill, shame on us."
,Washington: it's a strip club. The political class dances for the donor class and the working class get stuck with the tab. Americans are tired of it. They're tired of corrupt Washington elites. Let's burn down the Washington political machine and rebuild this country. No more leading from behind. No more losing. It's time for America to win again.
,"The idea of America is slipping away right in front of us. 18 trillion dollars of debt. A Supreme Court that thinks they're smarter than God. Obamacare when we can't afford the government we've got. If you're looking to elect somebody who's gonna manage the slow decline of this once great country, go vote for somebody else.

Well the hour seems pretty dark to me right now. We've exhausted every alternative. It is time to turn back to God. Believe Again is responsible for the content of this advertising.

,"Some people ask why Joe Biden. I turned back and asked them why not Joe Biden. He's been one of the most influential vice presidents that this country has seen. He is right now part one of the most successful administrations in recent history and he's a big reason for that success. An issue that Joe Biden really spoke out about since the beginning was gay rights. He was always for the LGBT community and we're very happy that we have a vice president like Joe Biden to support the Supreme Court in their ruling. As a college student, I appreciate the vice president's work to stop violence on college campuses with the It's On Us Campaign. He's somebody that has really supported the younger generation's beliefs. In my opinion, there's nobody more qualified than Joe Biden to be president at this point in time. In 2016, I'm ridin' with Biden. In 2016, I'm ridin' with Biden. In 2016, I'm ridin' with Biden. I'm definitely ridin' with Biden."
,"If we nominate another Bush or give voice to Trump on Mexicans, Hillary Clinton will win and it'll be our fault. George Pataki beat Mario Cuomo and won three elections in the most Democrat state. Pataki led on 9/11, cut taxes and grew his state's economy, not by focusing on abortion and gay rights, but by reaching across the aisle. Nominate someone who knows how to win. George Pataki. He'll beat Hillary Clinton."
,"I will not forget the lessons of September 11th. And yes, if necessary, American forces will be used to actually defeat and destroy ISIS so they can pose no threat to us here.

,"Some of the candidates. Ready for Hillary. Anything else you say. Single. Say China. With these new asymmetrical. So I have a. Fundamental American. People are. I don't think a good leader really reads polls, or listens to focus groups or who yells the loudest. A good leader has a sense, an intuition, about what's just and what's fair for people. And that's their obligation, their responsibility. To make sure they stand up for the folks."
,"Conservatives think. I think. I recognized. They should have said something. Red state, blue state. They don't know what they're doing. I have learned.

Not because it was about numbers, but it was cause about values. We don't have a right to live beyond our means and make sure that our children pay the debt. John Kasich helped balance the federal budget, turned around the Ohio economy, and has eighteen years experience on the Armed Services Committee. No one else comes close.

Santorum also wrote and passed tough laws putting harsh sanctions on Iran. And for more than a decade, Rick Santorum has been a leader taking on radical Islam. Not all Muslims are jihadists and no one would say that. But the reality is, all jihadists are Muslims. You want someone to read one hell of a bedtime story. Ted Cruz is your guy. If you want to protect America and defeat ISIS, Rick Santorum is your president, because serious times need serious people. I'm Rick Santorum and I approve this message."

The Constitution defines America and it guarantees our rights. The President swears to preserve, protect and defend it. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. Or breaching the freedom of the speech or of the press. The Des Moines Register said yesterday that all of its journalists have been barred from attending this event today. The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated. Maybe he should have been roughed up. I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and will to the best of my ability. Preserve, protect and defend. Preserve, protect and defend. Preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. The Constitution of the United States. I don't think Mr. Trump gets the whole Constitution thing."
,"Over the past few years people have tried to sell us some real doozies. But this is really worth something. When people see for themselves, I don't have to convince them it's a good investment. I don't have to show them the value for their family. So when this guy walked into my shop, I knew he was the real deal. It's time for a president who will stand up to runaway government and fight Washington special interests in both parties. Trust me, I know a good investment when I see it. I'm Marco Rubio and I approved of this message."
,"Do you like Vladimir Putin's comments about you? Sure. I'm greatly honored by his statement. I think it's terrific. You know, one of the things that you didn't take an opportunity to do last night was to really go after Donald Trump. Again, he kills journalists that don't agree with him. Well I think our country does plenty of killing also, Joe. Having known Donald Trump for thirteen years now, he looks like a serious candidate to me. This is an un-Republican thing for me to say. Universal health care? I am going to take care of everybody. Senator Cruz, you have not been willing to attack Mr. Trump in public. But you did question his judgment. You better not attack me. I salute Donald Trump and and listen, I commend Donald Trump. Jeb Bush quickly denounced Trump, tweeting quote a true freedom-loving conservative wouldn't be flattered by praise from a despot like Putin. Where only Jeb Bush really challenging. He seemed like he was the only one willing to take on Donald Trump. And certainly he was the most aggressive in doing so. Jeb Bush was the only one who tried to go after Donald Trump."
,"I remember the sounds of his keys jingling at the front door of our home well past midnight as he returned from another long day at work. When I was younger, I didn't fully appreciate all he did for us. But now I more fully understand it. You see my father was grateful for the work he had. But that was not the life he wanted for his children. He wanted all the dreams he once had for himself to come true for us. He wanted all the doors that closed for him to open for me. And so my father stood behind a small, portable bar in the back of a room for all those years so that I could stand behind this podium in front of this room and this nation. That journey from behind that bar to behind this podium. That's the essence of the American Dream. I'm Marco Rubio and I approved of this message."

,"For Lynn's family, the big stress is paying $400 a month in medical and drug costs for Aidan. For other families, it's higher deductibles, premiums and co-pays that keep adding up.

Because we've got to get health care costs under control for Lynn's family and for yours. I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message."
,"Hope. A word some have misused. But a compassionate Governor Mike Huckabee has never lost hope. In Hope, Arkansas, he learned this exceptional country can only be explained by the providence of God. Pro-life because life begins at conception.

Those at the top are doing just fine. It's your family that needs a raise. I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message."
,"I'm Congressman Jim Bridenstine. As a Navy pilot I flew combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan to protect both Americans and our Constitution. I just watched a despicable ad from one of Marco Rubio's campaign supporters suggesting that Ted Cruz is weak on security. I have watched Ted Cruz boldly stand against President Obama's appeasement of those who threaten our security from Iran to ISIS to Russia. Further, I have seen Ted Cruz stand up to both Obama and Marco Rubio when they joined forces to provide amnesty without border security. The Rubio amnesty bill would have expanded the U.S. refugee resettlement program and given Obama authority to admit even more Syrian refugees. Ted Cruz will rebuild our military, take the fight to the radical Islamic terrorists and never apologize for America. He will use every tool we have to win, but he will never betray the very Constitution we are sworn to defend. Ted Cruz is ready to be our Commander-in-Chief."

,"In the race for President, one candidate is very different from the others. One who grew up in a house without running water and worked his way to governor.

,"Overnight FBI and Homeland Security. The images are so. Manufacturing. President. President. I would veto that. We have a President. We don't have a king. How does a country that's lost find its way back? Start in a place called Paint Creek, Texas. A wide spot in the road where farmers raise crops from drought-stricken fields and where, in a farmhouse with no indoor plumbing, a boy named Rick Perry learned lessons of strength, resilience and faith in God. He became an Eagle Scout, an Air Force pilot, and married a woman he first met when he was eight years old. He took those lessons to the highest office in Texas and did what no one thought could be done. Helped create more than two million new jobs, forty percent of the country's jobs since 2009. And Texas had the second highest high school graduation rate in the country. The weakness and incompetence of our government shouldn't be confused with the strength, the ingenuity and the idealism of the American people. America can find it's strength again.

,"Madison, Wisconsin, 2011. Big government union bosses lead thousands of liberal activists in protest against Governor Scott Walker's bold reforms. They stormed the capital, threatened his safety, even tried to recall him. But Scott Walker never backs down. To eliminate a huge 3.6 billion dollar deficit, he takes decisive action. The results. A billion dollar surplus. Two billion dollars in tax relief. The unemployment rate cut nearly in half. And Walker forces government unions to pay their fair share for benefits just like everyone else does. Time after time, Scott Walker fights and wins. Our big, bold reforms here in Wisconsin took the power out of the hands of the big government special interests and put them firmly into the hands of the hardworking taxpayers.

,"Today, the United States has reached a historic understanding with Iraq. New revelations of a secret side agreement in the Iran nuclear deal. They get 24 days notice of an inspection. They get to pick their own inspectors. We think this is a historic mistake. This is a deal which we cannot lock our country into. I think it's a bad deal. It actually paves a path for Iran to have a nuclear weapon. But you you will rip up the agreement if there's one when you become President? I'll certainly look at it. One thing that I won't do is to say, as a candidate, I'm gonna tear up the agreement on the first day. I refuse to live with a deal that threatens our safety and that of our closest allies. See, unlike others, I don't need months or years to mull this over. If Congress fails to stop the nuclear deal, I will terminate it on day one. American leadership is back and together with our allies, we will not surrender another inch of ground. America will not be intimidated and neither will I. Thank you very much"
,"When there was a crisis at our border last year and the President refused my invitation to see that challenge, I told him, Mr. President, if you do not secure this border, Texas will.

,"See, most governors running for President now say what conservative audiences want to hear. President Obama's massive expansion of the broken Medicaid system under Obamacare. I opposed it from day one. What about our children's share of the federal debt? Justifying Medicaid expansion on the grounds of returning federal money to your home state can only be done if you turn a blind eye to the fact that we are 18 trillion dollars in debt. I will never trade freedom for federal money. Never. But things were a little different when they were governors and not campaigning."
,"When I visited refugee camps in Jordan, I was overwhelmed by the degree of pain caused by the war in Syria. These people had been forced from their homes with nothing but what they could carry. Yet every person I talked to had hope. Hope to return to their lives and to rebuild their shattered country. They didn't want to move to a new country. They wanted a safe and prosperous Syria where their families could flourish. Refugee camps and regional safe zones can work when properly funded and protected. America can help not by bringing these refugees to our shores, but by supporting solutions like these while working toward peace and stability in Syria."

,"Hillary Clinton I think is a terrific woman. I mean, I'm a little biased because I've known her for years. I knew Donald Trump. I represented New York. I got to know him. I live in New York, she lives in New York, and I've known her and her husband for years, and I really like them both a lot. You were at his wedding. I was at his wedding, that's right. Is it like where you guys all pretend to dislike each other and then you're all pals behind the scenes. I think she really works hard and I think she does a good job. You know, you'll be looking at the record of Hillary Clinton and how did she do as Secretary of State. Probably above and beyond everybody else, on everything else. What difference at this point does it make? Donald Trump gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation. And that was my obligation. They call me and whatever I wanted, I got. Billionaires basically using government for their own private economic interest. This is not Donald Trump. Yes it's Donald Trump. It's you and your cronies in government, working together. I've helped Nancy Pelosi. I've helped Reid. I'm a businessman. When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them, they are there for me. Invariably there are allegations of corruption, insider dealing. This is sort of the ultimate in crony capitalism. We're gonna make such great deals. That's the deal. A comprehensive, long-term deal. Lobbying and backroom deals. Uh the pharmaceutical industry made its deals. The medical device makers made their deals. Who would you be able to deal with to cut a deal? I'm going to be able to get along with Pelosi. I always had a great relationship with Harry Reid. I'm kind of pulling for him. You're going to meet with a good friend of mine, Senator Chuck Schumer. I was born in Brooklyn, the same place where Donald Trump's family comes from. His father and my grandfather were builders together in Brooklyn. How committed was Senator Rubio to getting this big deal through with a pathway to citizenship? Not only totally committed, he was in that room with us for hours a day, week after week after week. I think I'll be able to get along well with Schumer, Chuck Schumer. I was always very good with Schumer. We've been contacted by the establishment-types. They're contacting us left and right about joining the campaign. Mitch McConnell is very shrewd. He knows how to make a deal. He aspires to be a deal-maker. Uh, the Cromnibus. They have a deal. Democrats and Republicans actually negotiated. I'm ready to cut the deal today. We don't have to wait until the 11th hour. McConnell is hinting deals could be reached on tax reform and trade. And I mean these are real establishment people that I've known when I was a member of the establishment , meaning a giver, a big donor. Let's get to be a little establishment. I've been doing deals for a long time. That's what I do. Guys like Ted Cruz will never make a deal."

She's not with us anymore and there's this hole shaped like her in her family and in her community and among her classmates that never ever gets filled. Hillary Clinton is addressing the issue of gun violence prevention. It's clear from the way she talks about it that she's talking from conviction and I do think that Hilary Clinton has been very forthright in calling out the leadership of these organizations like the NRA.

Like the teacher who saw my mother had no money for food and started bringing her extra from home, whispering, 'You know, Dorothy, I just brought too much food today.' She went to work in somebody else's home at age 14, and it opened her eyes. For the first time, she saw parents who loved and cared for their children, and that's the kind of loving family she provided for us. When she needed a champion, someone was there.

When have you stood and fought to stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons? I would encourage each of you to ask every single candidate who stands up in front of you, you say you believe these principles, show me when have you stood up and fought for them. When have you bled for them? What have you accomplished? The responsibility of this great state in the Republican party is to ensure that we nominate a conservative."

She kept saying, Hillary, don't put your light under a bushel basket. I didn't really quite understand what that meant, but I knew she was telling me, Keep going, do everything you can, and let your light shine too. I think we should support teachers, not make them the scapegoats for America's problems. We should defend against attacks on collective bargaining. We should listen to educators about what's working and what's not, because when we unlock the potential of all our children, we can unlock the potential of America."
,"There are other areas the federal government has no business being involved in and right at the top of that list is education. Education is too important for it to be governed by unelected bureaucrats in Washington. It needs to be at the state level, or even better, at the local level, where we have direct control over it. And we need to repeal every word of Common Core. It will only come from millions of courageous conservatives rising up to say we want our country back."

Congressman Steve King supports Ted Cruz for President. I'm committed. I'm all the way in supporting Ted Cruz for President. The courts are the battleground and Ted Cruz is on our side. He'll make the right appointments to all the federal courts, not just the Supreme Court. And Congressman King knows Ted Cruz stands strong on national security.

,"Why are Marco Rubio's Rhino donors attacking Ted Cruz for fighting Barack Obama's NSA spying? Because Ted Cruz is surging in the polls and Rubio's people are desperate. Desperate because Rubio stood with Obama and Chuck Schumer on his Gang of 8 amnesty scheme and it's hurting, so Rubio's lashing out, attacking Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz stood up to Obama and clamped down on Obama's NSA spying. And Ted Cruz has been the top voice against Obama's radical agenda. Marco Rubio? He ran for Senate as a Tea Party candidate, but when he got elected, Rubio teamed up with Mitch McConnell, John McCain and Lindsey Graham to fight against everything we believe in. Enough is enough. After eight years of Obama, and weak Republicans who coddle and enable him, it's time. Time for Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz for President. Now, before it's too late.

Can anyone think of anything Marco Rubio's ever done? Anything at all besides amnesty? Marco Rubio looks good on TV but that's about it. Ted Cruz for President. Ted Cruz walks tall for what we believe. Standing up, often standing alone, Ted Cruz makes things happen. After Sandy Hook, Ted Cruz stopped Obama's push for new gun control laws.

I've known John for 25 years. I served in Congress with him when he balanced the budget for the first time since John Armstrong walked on the moon. I've now seen it since Ted Strickland left Ohio in a mess, John Kasich picked up the pieces. He was left with a record deficit. He was left with the state that was falling behind, 48th in the country in job creation. Right now Ohio not only has a balanced budget but actually $2 billion dollar surplus and we've also got a situation where unemployment numbers now below the national average instead of above and we're top 10 in the country job creation. These are results results that matter to the families that I represent Ohio. So John's a friend. I've known him for 25 years.

And these allegations started in Phoenix but it was Fort Collins and Austin, San Antonio Cheyenne, St. Louis and later today there'll be another one. But in part because there has been real scandal. There has been but it's not been as widespread as it has been made out to be.

You have to give them a path and you have to make it possible for them to succeed. You have to do that. How do you throw someone out that's lived in this country for 20 years? You just can't throw everybody out. And why does Trump support amnesty? Maybe because Trump makes big money off illegal immigrants. A federal court ruled that Trump's company hired illegal immigrants to help the construction process for Trump Tower. He even paid a million dollar fine. And his new hotel in Washington?

Tell me about who this one is, and who that one is, and why are you so impressed with Hillary Clinton?' And I said, she believes in our DREAMers. She believes in our kids. She believes in healthcare. She believes in retirement security.' And it was like Stop. Okay, I get it! Everyone's gonna get it."
,People want change they want reform they want to see something done. But just carping about it and whining about it and making speeches about it doesn't get it done.

,"The problem with climate change is that there's never been a day in the history of the world in which the climate is not changing. I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it. To say the science on this is decided is just really arrogant, to be honest with you. I'm not a huge believer in the global warming phenomenon. For me, we need to be transitioning from fossil fuels --I know it will take time -- to clean renewable energy. That's why I led with my two big proposals, namely I want to see us by the end of my first term have installed a half a billion more solar panels and by the end of my second term have enough clean power to run all the homes in America."

And then the other thing is, like when I was in the Senate or Secretary of State, you just have to work with them all the time and you just have to find where are those areas that you can cooperate on.

,"Jeb Bush is someone who is not satisfied with the status quo. His education reform plan transformed how children were taught and what children were taught and it set the bar very, very high.

He wanted to make sure that every student had a chance to learn He empowers everyone else with the energy that he has to lead our children and our nation forward."

We're going to do what the Democratic party has done many other years and that is to offer up a new leader for a new generation. There are many fine people running for our party's nomination, but only one of us has 15 years of experience."

My favorite story with Dr. Carson was that he really respected who he was as a role model for the children. And one day I had a young child who was in the preoperative area and he said , oh is Dr. Carson here , I'd like to meet him. He wasn't Dr. Carson's patient. But my girlfriend found Dr. Carson later, and let him know this child really wants to meet you and let him know where he was gonna be in the hospital and he went out of his way to go and meet that young man , and just love on him. He's just who he was as a role model, he embraced that, and empowered me."

But he failed us and gave us first Pelosi and Reid, then Obama. Republicans took back congress but instead of fighting Obama, they'd rather fight Ted Cruz. Why? Because Ted Cruz threatens their power. We're sick of failed losers and their stale, bad advice. The Bushes, the Doles, the McCains, the Romneys: they failed us. It's time to win again.

And if he gets the Republican nomination the next thing Trump gives the Clintons might be a nice piece of real estate."

So we will have quality, affordable health care for every American. We are going to take care of everybody. I'm. I don't care if it costs me votes or not. The government's gonna pay for it.

,"Senator Sanders wants to dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the CHIP program, dismantle Medicare, dismantle private insurance. Look, this attack is not just is it strange politically because democratic base is with Bernie Sanders on single-payer or Medicare for All but it's just so disingenuous, they're arguing, and we do have a journalistic responsibility to say that a lot of what Chelsea Clinton said there was misleading I mean, in many ways, represent misrepresented, distorted, distorting, his views on that, sending Chelsea Clinton out to attack Bernie Sanders not speaking the truth. It's just a lie because the only way in which he would ever go to Medicare for All is as replace for the Affordable Care Act, which would be even broader universal coverage instead of near universal coverage. Now Chelsea Clinton is no stranger to the campaign trail but these barbs are not what we saw from her in '08. It's a notable response to clearly what is mounting pressure so health care."

He's extremely violent. Been in 18 fights, extortion, dealing drugs and tried to kill another inmate. He was moved to a maximum security prison and received 29 disciplinaries and zero achievements. Why on earth are you asking for his release? He has recently found the lord. While governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee's 1,033 prisoners -- twice the number of his three predecessors combined. Voters need to know the truth about Mike Huckabee."
,"Ohio Governor John Kasich continues his bid to the Granite State today. This comes after he picked up a new endorsement by Foster's Daily Democrat and the Portsmouth Herald. This morning looks like Governor John Kasich also going up in the polls. He always been an outsider trying to change from within. When he was in Congress he balanced the budget, he transformed Ohio. He has common sense, which a lot of politicians don't have today. A fine human being. Very real and very likely, when you get to know him, you want to be his best friend, or you want him to be your best friend. According to overtime politics Kasich is running second behind Donald Trump. I look at that Monmouth Survey in New Hampshire and I think he's the one who could emerge in New Hampshire. Now of course every candidate boasts of having the best ground operation but perhaps the most expansive belongs to John Kasich. His footprint on the ground here is huge. And New Hampshire's critical. If I do well here, if I become a story out of here, I really think I'll be president. It's up to you but no big deal."
,"Jeb had I thought his best night. To be honest with you Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster. Think about it she's under investigation with the FBI right now, if she gets elected her first hundred days instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse. Under president Jeb Bush we would restore the strength of the military. He had the courage to take on Trump on the Muslim immigration issue in a direct way. This policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out out ISIS. Wwe don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously? What kind of signals does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security. That last back and forth between two centered, backbench senators explains why we have the mess in Washington D.C. Credibility counts. There will be people here that will talk about what they're gonna do, I've done it. I ask for your support to build together a safer and stronger America."
,"I'm running for President and I want people to know what's in my heart, I want people to know how I make decisions, how I view life itself. When I wake up each day I say a prayer, it's my strength. Hillary Clinton said people of faith just have to get over it basically, you can pray in your home and you can pray in the church pews, but you can't act on your faith you can't act on your consciousness and that's just wrong. We should never restrict that. It is a loving act of consciousness it's not anything that's judgmental at all. Secretary Clinton insists that when the progressive agenda encounters religious beliefs to the contrary, those beliefs quote have to be changed. The most galling example is the shabby treatment of the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Christian charity that dared to voice objections of conscience to Obamacare. It comes down to a choice between the Little Sisters and Big Brother and I'm going with the sisters."
,"Dr. King's vision for America was based on equality of opportunity, and in America today we have been more successful and tearing down the racial barriers in all sorts of ways and that's good, and there's more to be done there. But what's lagged behind as the simple fact, particularly kids in poverty, don't have a chance because they have not been able to access to quality education. That's why I'm for school choice. That's why I'm for robust accountability. That's why I believe that there should be a real focus on early childhood education so that everybody has a chance to rise up. Because without a quality education there is no equality of opportunity it is the civil rights issue of our time."
,I was blessed as a child to have a mother who recognized the value of a good education. Despite having only completed the third grade she understood that knowledge is key and instilled in me an appreciation for learning and reading. My own personal experiences have made me acutely aware that education is the ladder that can lead out of poverty and into realizing the American Dream. In recent years there has been a troubling trend with our government officials trying to dictate how children are educated in our country this must stop and Common Core must be overturned. Our education system needs to be run by caring parents along with engaged teachers and principals. The Department of Education and my administration will promote school choice by parents through support school for voucher programs and charter schools.
,"The weakness and fecklessness of President Obama's foreign policy has created a world in which America is no longer trusted by its allies and not respected by its adversaries. For the survival of freedom it is imperative that strength and decisiveness return to the White House. Unlike President Obama I will lead from the front and ensure a secure America through strength, deterrence and principled leadership, specifically that means defeating terrorism, confronting aggression from countries like Iran. Deterring adventurism by Russia and China and standing by our allies such as Israel. It's also time to reinvigorate NATO as a meaningful defense alliance. President Obama and his former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have embarked on many apology tours around the world leading people to believe that America is the world's problem. I deeply believe that America is an exceptional nation and as President I would stand proudly for those values each and every day."

We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. People should not have to work for starvation wages. So we are making progress, there are cities and states moving in the direction of $15 an hour. That is my goal. If elected president that's what I will fight for. Keep up the great work thank you very much."
,Hey Fusion. I saw your #DearNextPresident question about reducing deaths from gun violence and also reforming criminal justice in our country. We need to do both of those things and do them together. As a governor I actually passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons and universal background checks. We can do it as a nation. Secondly I've learned is a big city mayor and as a governor that there is no entity in our government that requires openness and transparency more than of policing efforts. That's why I put forward a plan for criminal justice reform to better deliver on the promise of equal protection under the law for all Americans. Thanks a lot.
,"One candidate has experience negotiating with other countries to reduce climate change. Who believes in global warming? And her green energy plan will improve the health of all of us. Who believes in climate change? Raise your hand. Nobody? Mr. Trump, I do. We're not going to keep silent when they say climate change isn't real. So we're going to fight and we're going to win."
,"You know, we're trying to shed some light on it. Even today we're gonna have a vote on Audit the Fed. I think that's the first step. I have a message, a message that is loud and clear and does not mince words. We have come to take our country back."
,The decision to kick you off the main stage is to me absolutely disgraceful and shameful. I have a message. A message that is loud and clear. It does not mince words. We have come to take our country back.
,"And I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. See when you're a senator what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk and talk so much that nobody ever keep up with what you're saying. I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. In Iowa now as you know Ted, in the last three polls I'm beating you. Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. And we don't need a weak person being President of the United States, ok because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb. No you already had your chance Marco, and you blew it. You used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it. I appreciate your dumping your oppo research folder on on the debate, no it's your record. At least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false. I would try to convince them otherwise but this last back and forth between two senators, backbench senators, it explains why we have the mess in Washington D.C. I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV."
,"Throughout my life I have been told by many people don't challenge the status quo, just sit down and be quiet, don't rock the boat, just accept this is the way things are. We don't care for our veterans, we are crushing small businesses, we don't secure our borders. We don't keep our nation safe. That is why I'm running for president. It is time to take our country back. I'm Carly Fiorina and I approve this message."
,"It was an attack on American sovereignty. The World Court ordered a stay of execution for an illegal immigrant convicted of murder. Standing in their way was Ted Cruz. As Solicitor General in Texas, Cruz fought the United Nations and won, defending the Constitution and states rights. As president, Cruz will make sure foreign courts can never put their laws above ours. Tested, trusted, ready to lead. I'm Ted Cruz and I approve this message."
,"It's the fight among candidates. It's become a circular firing squad. What do you think of Ted Cruz? I don't think he's qualified to be President, a little bit of maniac. I don't care whether his name is Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio you never won a thing of consequence in your life. Chris Christie is missing out in New Jersey most of the time That's why his numbers are there so terrible. If Senator Rubio would just show up for work every once in awhile he only got one job. I mean literally the Senate, what is it like a French work week? When it comes to Ted he has changed his position on immigration all over the place. Marco's campaign is lying. He's not told the truth about his position in the past on legalization. I can't hear you. How would you like to spend $59 million in your three? See this young guy over here? Stand up. Stand up. If I spend $59 million on him, he'd be at at least five. I'm a big boy. You're a tough guy Jeb. Why is it that everybody is attacking everybody except you? Total joke. Bunch of clowns, bunch of real clowns."
,"GOP presidential hopeful taking part in the Jack Kemp Presidential forum that's being moderated by Paul Ryan. He still wants to cut taxes on the rich but he also wants to punish the poor. More and more takers not makers. More takers than makers in society where we will have turned our safety net into a hammock. We're tangling people's lives of dependance, webs of dependence that encourage them not to move forward in their lives but to lay back. John Kasich's budget is getting a hard look. It would eliminate Medicaid benefits for certain pregnant women and others. We don't need marshmallows we need toughness. It means people need to work longer hours. Because our message is one of hope and aspiration. It isn't one of division and get in line and we'll take care of you with free stuff. Just wipe out the $1.2 trillion dollars of debt without reform of our higher education system, more free stuff. You veto things. To tell you the truth, I'm tired of hearing about the minimum wage. I don't think the minimum wage law works. You give nearly twice as much of a gain in after-tax income to the top one percent."
,"Who you gonna vote for? Kasich. We've been able to meet with the great people of the state of New Hampshire, we visited David's House yesterday which is a wonderful program like the Ronald McDonald homes , where they provide a residence away from home for people with sick children. We have been to shelters for women who are victims of domestic violence. And we have been to several town halls where the girls even spoke about their father. He is the most loving and caring person out of all of them. He's the most experienced and the only one I feel comfortable with. That's a little biased because he's my dad... So we really need your help to keep this momentum going. Check out what you can do to help John win by going to JohnKasich.com"
,Jeb Bush couldn't fix Florida so he dropped higher costs on everyone. Jeb put higher costs on low-income kids who went to the doctor. Jeb hiked tuition on college students eight years in a row. Jeb even raised fees on owning a pet snake. If this was the best Jeb could do when times were good how can we ever trust him to get America back on track? The truth is Jeb Bush isn't strong enough to lead.
,One of the things I'm most proud about is that I create jobs. Over the years tens of thousands of jobs for our country and I'll do that for you. I will tell you this and I can say it with certainty I will be the greatest jobs producing president that God ever created. I love the subject I love doing it and I love helping people and there is nothing like helping people then getting them and their family great jobs.
,"One of the things I'm gonna do and largely with our great tax plan, where everybody's taxes is going down, we're going to grow our economy. We have to get rid of the $19 trillion in debt -- so unfair so totally unfair to our young people. We are not gonna leave you with that burden."
,It takes a lot of courage to run for president especially if you're a non-politician which I'm proud to say I am a non politician. But the journey has been an unbelievably interesting one and fascinating. I've met so many great people so many people that want to be a part of government and they want to do such wonderful things for the country. America's been great to me I wanna be great to America. I want to do something that's really going to put us back on the right course and make America great again.
,"We don't have a country if we don't have borders. We will build a wall. It will be a great wall, it will do what it's supposed to do: keep illegal immigrants out. Now, with that said, we're going to have a beautiful big door right in the middle of that wall and people are going to come into our country and they're going to come in legally and we want people to come in and we want to treat people fairly. But we either have a country or we don't. We need a border we need a wall. I took a tremendous amount of heat when I started talking about illegal immigration. I turned out to be right now everybody's talking about it but they still don't get it. We have to stop the inflow of illegals coming into our country, that has to be stopped. It has to be stopped now."
,"One of the things that made Ronald Reagan a great president is that he understood that America is a nation like any other that has existed throughout human history. He knew it was founded on universal principles that were powerful, the dignity of all people, human rights, the rights of all to live to live in freedom and liberty and to choose their own path in life. He just didn't believe it, he acted on it. I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us and that doesn't have to be true. Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now. Today I'm proud to announce my endorsement of Marco Rubio. Our country needs a new generation of leadership. I think when you see Marco Rubio debate skills you can see Republicans saying who do I want going up again potentially Hillary Clinton? The Democrats have the ultimate super PAC. It's called the mainstream media. You better be able to lead our country on the first day not six months from now not a year from now on the first day in office our president could very well confront a national security crisis. Rubio won. He was the only candidate I gave a solid A to."
,"There's a different feeling in America. What if her best days are behind her. What is there is nothing left to do but brace for what's ahead. One thing is true: America won't accept defeat. Sure you may have taken a hit, even been knocked down. But that's not the end of the story not even close because there is someone who believes in her promise, who has fought for her all of his life and won. When America begins to fade we need a trusted leader to restore her promise. Freedom is personal for me and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom. What if the best is still to come?"
,"A crisis erupts, full of fury, threatening lives and futures. We must trust one person with the strength to make the right decision to keep us secure. One whose wisdom, faith and experience has protected lives in the face of death for over 30 years. With things most dire, thousands of families have trusted Dr. Ben Carson to keep them secure. We can trust him too. I'm Ben Carson and I approved this message."
,"Here's the real issue. Do we still have standards? Do we still have values and principles? You see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society. Where did that spirit come from in America? It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots. The majority of people in America actually have values and principles, and they believe in the very things that made America great. It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in. I'm Ben Carson and I approved this message."
,"Marco Rubio ran for Senate saying he opposed amnesty, then he broke his promise joining with Liberal Democrats to co-author the path to citizenship bill. His fingerprints are all over that bill. Rubio joked: Actually, I changed my mind...no, I'm kidding. Only he wasn't. He's flipped on his own bill, now telling us: When I'm president, there will be no amnesty. But with his record on immigration, how can we trust Rubio on anything? Right To Rise USA is responsible for the content of this message."

,Hello I'm Governor Martin O'Malley. I'm a lifelong Democrat and I'm running for President of the United States to bring new leadership forward for our country and to build upon the good work that President Obama and Vice President Biden have done. With new leadership together we can achieve big things again as a nation. We can get things done. That's why I put forward a plan to move us to 100% clean electric grid by 2050. I'm running for President to bring new leadership to our country and build on President Obama's progress. I need your help. Thanks a lot.
,"Washington is broken and both parties are to blame. But it will never get better if we keep sending people to Washington who will say or do anything to get elected.

I've got the best people in the world and we're gonna use them.
,"If I'm our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton gonna lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck. I was raised paycheck to paycheck. Because you better be able to lead our country on the first day. Not six months from now. Not a year from now. On the first day in office, our President could very well confront a national security crisis. The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you. Here's the bottom line. I'm not. My campaign is going to be about the future of America. Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers. For over 200 years, this has been a special country. A unique place where anyone from anywhere can achieve anything. Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander-in-chief of the United States."

And finally would they kill a duck and put him in a pot and make 'em a good duck gumbo? I've looked at the candidates. Ted Cruz is my man. He fits the bill. He's godly, he loves us, he's the man for the job. And he will go duck hunting cause today we're going. Ted Cruz is my man. I'm voting for him. The reason we're going to vote for you, all of us, is you're one of us, my man. Thank you. That's why we're voting for you. It's now or never."

,"We will not defeat radical Islamic terrorism so long as we have a President unwilling to utter the words radical Islamic terrorist. What we need is a Commander-In-Chief who makes clear if you join ISIS, if you wage jihad on America, then you are signing your death warrant.

,Heard that silly ethanol lobby ad attacking Ted Cruz? It's a lie. Ted Cruz opposes all energy subsidies including oil subsidies just like any conservative should and Cruz has the guts to say it in iowa. That's real conservative leadership. But when has Marco Rubio ever taken a conservative stand? We all know about Rubio and Schumer's Gang of Eight amnesty scheme but there's more. Rubio backed sugar subsidies as well as ethanol. Rubio's endorsed paid family leave funded by taxpayers and NSA spying on citizens. Marco Rubio looks good on TV but that's about it. Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz for president now before it's too late. Wouldn't it be nice to nominate for president someone as committed to conservative values as Barack Obama is too liberal...

,"Hearing the rhetoric that's going on in the media makes me sick. Because I as an individual, I'm constantly trying to raise awareness and make sure that everyone is treated equally in this country. So to the next President of the United States, what do you think about that? My father's family died in concentration camps. I will do everything that I can to rid this country of the ugly stain of racism. There is a lot of anger being generated and hatred being generated against Muslims in this country. And if we stand for anything, we have got to stand together and end all forms of racism, and I will lead that effort as President of the United States. I'm Bernie Sanders, and I approve this message."

Jane Horton is sitting with my wife here today. Her husband Chris was killed in action in Afghanistan and Jane spends her time now defending and fighting for military families. They're both heroes. It reminds me the job I'm running for is a serious one, you can't be making statements that you regret later. In campaigns you can you can go overboard, you're running just to be commander-in-chief United States your word matters. I wear it everyday. I got three of them actually three different families. It's just a good reminder of what the job's about. I think we need a commander-in-chief you need someone who's really focused on the greatness of our country and we keep it safe. I appreciate you.

No, we are now finally where we need to be. That this isn't our problem. Why do we care? Let ISIS and Syria fight. He says that ISIS is not our fight. Really? Islamic terrorism is not a threat to the United States? Tell that the family members of the people in San Bernardino. We need someone who has a steady hand who has plans to keep us safe.

,"This is a CBS News special report a presidential address to the nation. From Washington, here is Scott Pelley. Good evening. It is the beginning of the end but just the beginning. The plan he will announce is not what his generals wanted but with the U.S. economy struggling, the government deep in debt. Here is the president in the East Room of the White House. When it comes to great steaks I just raised the stakes. Trump stakes are the world's greatest steaks and I mean that in every sense of the word. Trump steaks are by far the best tasting most flavorful beef you've ever had. Truly in a league of their own. Until now you could only enjoy stakes of this quality in one of my resort restaurants or America's finest steak houses. But now that's changed and believe me I understand steaks. It's my favorite food and these are the best."
,"He's the smartest person on the stage by a long shot. Doesn't have the political experience but quite frankly I'm grateful for that. I don't want a professional politician I don't want someone who was so polarizing that if they got elected they could accomplish nothing we have lots of people in washington D.C. with lots and lots of years of political experience who quite frankly are selling us down the tubes. You need a president who's a good manager. When Ben Carson developed the process for separating conjoined twin to the head, Carson then went out to the world of neurosurgery and said 'what do I have right what do I have wrong' help me. And Carson being anything but an egotist took in all of the information from all of these other neurosurgeons and finalized the process so that that process is now the accepted way of doing this surgery. You can as president surround yourself with people with lots of political experience with lots of savvy on on how the congress should interact with the White House with the judicial and that's what we need is a person in Washington D.C. with the common sense experience with being led by God by wanting to do the very best for the American people. Dr Ben Carson is the only candidate on stage who can heal America."
,"We will carpet bomb them into oblivion. I don't know if sand can glow in the dark but we're going to find out. Assad is one of the main reasons why ISIS even exists to begin with. Anti-american dictators like Assad if they go I will not shed a tear. I have never supported the use of military force, of US military force in this conflict and I still don't. I remain unconvinced that the use of force proposed here will work. All of us are outraged at Assad's conduct and he rightly should be subject to condemnation worldwide. But an attack? I think a military attack is a mistake. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio had a chance to stand for fighting against Assad and ISIS and both backed away because it wasn't popular at the time. We need someone with a steady hand with proven leadership skills and the ability to go to congress to get an authorization to use military force to rid this from the face of the Earth."

The 32 year old head of a pharmaceutical company raised the price of a life-saving drug overnight by 5,000 percent I'm announcing a detailed plan to crack down on these abuses.

,"President Obama gave away the store to the Iranians. To a group of people who since 1979 have been chanting death to America. This was negotiated so badly that you wouldn't let this President buy a car for you at a car dealership. Now he's lying to the American people about how the deal's gonna work. I would have walked away from the table. That's what Ronald Reagan did when he walked away from Mikhail Gorbachev in Reykjavik. And so as President, the top priority is to protect the United States of America and I'm the only one in this race who has had at least some small part of that responsibility. I'm Chris Christie and I approved this message."
,"Iraq 2005. Hundreds of Americans have been killed in roadside bomb attacks. Six were killed in attacks linked to al-qaida terrorist Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi. A sniper and bomb-maker Alwan bragged he ate Americans for lunch and dinner. Kentucky 2009. Alwan and Hammadi were welcomed into America by the federal government given public housing and public assistance as refugees. Here they attempted to send heavy arms to al-qaida and plotted an attack on an army captain in America. And yet some refuse to learn from mistakes. We have welcomed refugees, the tired huddled masses for centuries. That's been the history of the United States. We should continue to do so. Well we've always been a country that's been willing to accept people who have been displaced and I would be open to that. But Rand Paul sounded the alarm. It is almost a certainty ISIS will infiltrate. Why should we take one of these people? As you know this is one of the reasons I opposed Rubio's bill originally on immigration because I don't think there's enough scrutiny for those who might come and attack us. Rand Paul wrote the amendment to suspend visas to nations nations with high risks of terrorism. But Marco Rubio voted no. Rand Paul is leading the fight to stop terrorism at our borders and protect Americans first."
,"Howdy, I'm Rick Perry. 2016 is a critical election and I'm here to stress to you how important it is for conservatives to rally together and support a consistent conservative candidate will take on Washington who can defeat the Democratic nominee. That's why I support Ted Cruz president. As an air force veteran I understand the sacrifices that our men and women in the military make every day. They deserve a commander-in-chief who values their service. Who will keep our military strong, who will always put America's national security interests first. He has proven that he is ready to serve as our commander-in-chief from day one. He has also proven the willingness to take on the Washington cartel and restore power and opportunity back to the people. He has proven that he'll do what is necessary to secure our borders to defeat radical islamic terrorism and ensure our brave veterans get the care they've earned. Ted is the leader that we need to reignite the promise of America. That's why I am supporting Ted Cruz and asking Iowa Republicans to caucus for Cruz next month, February the first."
,"What happened to Jeb? He had the name, the money, the support. And yet a lukewarm message, weak debates and sagging polls have left Jeb attacking John Kasich in desperation. John Kasich is a leader. He shrunk government, balanced budgets and cut taxes $5 billion and help create over 400,000 jobs. America there's a better brighter way. John Kasich. I'm John Kasich and I approve this message."

,"Let me ask you about your your positions in New Jersey. New Jersey has some of the toughest gun laws in the in the country. in '95 you ran on a platform of supporting the assault weapons ban. You said that GOP opponents that wanted to repeal it were dangerous crazy and radical and you supported in 2009. You ran against opposing attempts to permit concealed carry laws in New Jersey. Where do you stand now because you will appear to have changed. Well, listen, in 1995, Sean, I was 32 years old and I have changed my mind and the biggest reason I changed my mind was my seven years as a federal prosecutor. Are there any issues where you are moderate to left as a Republican? Well, listen, I favor some of the gun control measures we have in New Jersey and we have a densely populated state and there's a big hand gun problem in New Jersey. Now, I don't support all the things that the governor supports, by a long stretch, but I think looking at it from a law enforcement perspective, seeing how many police officers were killed, we have an illegal gun problem in New Jersey."
,"They call Ohio a bellwether state, It's a battleground state. It's a state that knows how to pick a President. As Ohio goes so goes the nation. In the critical critical Buckeye State of Ohio too close to call. Hillary Clinton will become the President-elect of the United States. I'm told inside the Clinton camp that there's a one Republican they're more nervous about than anyone else. It's John Kasich, the Ohio governor. You're a big Hillary Clinton supporter. Who would you least like her to run against? Who's the most substantive? I think John Kasich. I would fear John Kasich. John Podesta, and other top officials are saying they're a little bit nervous about somebody like John Kasich especially if he can carry Ohio, the Republicans do not win the White House traditionally unless you carry Ohio. I'm from Ohio. She will not meet me there. I can promise you that."
,"You know when we launched our campaign the New York Times promptly opined Cruz cannot win because the washington elites despise him. I kinda thought that was the whole point of the campaign. If you think things are going great in Washington, that we need to keep going in the same direction maybe, just fiddle around the edges, then I ain't your guy. On the other hand if you think Washington is fundamentally broken, that there is a bipartisan corruption of career politicians in both parties that get in bed with the lobbyists and grow and grow and grow government, and we he did take power out of Washington and back to We the People.

,"What is it gonna mean for Donald Trump to have Bill DeBlasio as mayor? Well I think he's a smart guy that knows what's going on really feel great and I think he's not going to want to destroy New York. That was Donald Trump a little over two years ago endorsing PC socialist Bill DeBlasio for New York Mayor. And I think pretty strongly that he'll end up being a good mayor, maybe a very good mayor. DeBlasio ran on class warfare, sanctuary cities and ending stop-and-frisk. DeBlasio sided with looters and cop killers against the police. With teachers unions against schoolchildren. And with PC liberals to let the homeless run wild on city streets. I think he's gonna wanna make New York great. So just why Trump endorsed Bill DeBlasio?

,"Happening this morning Bill Clinton is set to make his first solo appearance on behalf of his wife in New Hampshire. The last thing they want is to have this rehashed, it makes her uncomfortable as a candidate and when your candidate is uncomfortable, they're not good candidates. But no other candidate ... a reporter today asking President Clinton if those past allegations against him are fair game what they have to say? He pretty much dodged the question Jake. This is not the fight that the Clintons wanna have. This is not the way they want this campaign to be defined for all sorts of reasons and so I think, will former President Bill Clinton want to answer a question about this of course Andrea Mitchell asked him about it yesterday, he decided he wasn't going to engage. Former President Bill Clinton addressing the question but not directly engaging. And I think that in some of the most prominent cases not only were they accusations not disproven, they were confirmed that acknowledged by President Clinton."

,"Look, at any time that there is a crisis, a tragedy, whether it's San Bernardino or these tragic mass killings by deranged people, the first impulse of the President of the United States and Hillary Clinton is to take more rights away from law-abiding citizens and frankly the protection of the Second Amendment keeps us safe and keeps a strong and we should do everything we can to enhance that right. Law-abiding citizens that are trained to be able to protect themselves creates a safer America. There's evidence to this in every possible way but it just reeks of common sense as well.

,"Finally someone had the guts to tell it like it is. The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media. This is not a cage match.

Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen? How about talking about the substantive issues people care about? The media can't silence him. Washington can't break him, because everyone knows exactly where he stands. If elected President, enemies across this world will know the United States is not to be trifled with. We'll kill the terrorists. We'll repeal Obamacare and we will defend the Constitution, every single word of it. Crystal-clear vision. Strong, honest leadership. That's what it takes to win.

,"Yesterday a bipartisan group of senators announced their principles for comprehensive immigration reform, which are very much in line with the principles I've proposed and campaigned on for the last few years. The so-called Gang of 8 has wrapped up months of negotiations and will present a bill that includes a pathway to citizenship for many of the 11 million immigrants. The man at the center bringing together, Republican senator from Florida, Marco Rubio. Let's bring these people out of the shadows. They'll undergo a background check. He was the co-author of the bill, it was the Rubio bill, the Rubio-Schumer bill. His fingerprints are all over that bill. Did he resist the pathway to citizenship for the 11 million? No he understood it, he molded it, he made it. Three years ago in a debate you were clear on this, you said an earned pathway was amnesty. Yet you've changed your mind here, why? Do you support a path to citizenship for immigrants who are in the United States but are here illegally? I do but first we have to do two things. Why isn't that amnesty? Because in fact you are giving legal status to people who have broken the law. Actually I changed my mind. I'm kidding. So that's what comprehensive immigration reform looks like. Smarter enforcement. A pathway to earned citizenship. Ah, it's been fun."

A few weeks later during a debate on the senate floor Cruz repeated his belief that this amendment is the compromise that can pass and you repeated later in Princeton that if my amendment were adopted this bill would pass. It sounded like you wanted the bill to pass. We have welcomed refugees, the tired huddled masses for centuries. That's been the history of the United States. We should continue to do so."
,"One of the things my grandfather instilled in me was that I was really blessed because I was a citizen of the greatest country in the history of all mankind. But there have always been people in American politics I wanted America to be more like the rest of the world and in 2008 one of them was elected president of this country and the result has been a disaster. Today you have millions of Americans who feel left out and out of place in their own country, struggling to live paycheck to paycheck called bigots because they hold on to traditional values. And around the world America's influence has declined. While this president's destroyed our military our allies no longer trust us and our adversaries no longer respect us. That is why this election is so important that is why I'm running and that's why I'm going to ask you for your vote tonight. If you elect me president we will have a president that believes America is the greatest country in the world and we will have the president acts like it."
,"I mean I lived in New York City in Manhattan all my life , so you know my views are little bit different than if I lived in Iowa. They are different, like on abortion. Would President Trump ban partial-birth abortion? Well look, I am pro-choice in every respect. And what this Trump think about Iowa? How stupid are the people of Iowa? Donald Trump, New York values, not ours. You know , my views are a little bit different than if I lived in Iowa. I'm Ted Cruz and I approve this message."

You know, you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes blood coming out of her wherever. Somebody's doing the raping, Don. You know, I mean, somebody's doing this. Just think, it's women being raped. Well who's doing the raping? It moves this way, it moves that way. How stupid are the people of Iowa?"

He's going like, I don't remember, maybe that's what I said. The reporter he is talking about is Serge Kovaleski who works for the New York Times. As you can see right there he suffers from a chronic condition that impairs movement of his arms. Trump says he wasn't mocking the reported because he didn't know what the reporter looked like but in truth they have known each other personally for years. He's going like, I don't remember, maybe that's what I said."

,"We need a President who knows how to protect you and knows how it feels when we don't. I was named U.S. Attorney on September 10, 2001. The next day Mary Pat took the PATH train to the World Trade Center. She walked the two blocks to her office and turned on the television and the first building was on fire. I called Mary Pat immediately and I said, are you okay? They were telling her that they had to evacuate her to her basement. Five and a half hours passed. I thought about three things: What was I gonna do without my best friend? What am I gonna tell the kids? What kind of single parent would I be? The phone rang and I got the greatest phone call of my life. Mary pat was ok. Here's what I fear: We've become complacent as a country. We've gone all these years up until San Bernardino without another attack. I'll never forget. My wife was there. We lost friends. I know the loss and the pain and I know the fear of loss.

,"I don't know how to break this to ya. Donald Trump is very upset. It's very hard for him to deal with. I don't know what his relationship with women has been in his life, but. He has discovered that women go to the bathroom. And it's been very upsetting for him. And this is what I quote. Now, I was there at the debate we had on Saturday night. But I gotta be honest with you. I gotta be honest with you. I gotta lay it out on the table. I also went to the bathroom. I know, I know. I have to admit it. I guess I'm a man. Men are allowed to go to the bathroom. But women, what can we say? This is the quote, and this is the pathology. This is the guy who is leading in the Republican polls. This is what he said, quote. I know where she went. It's disgusting. This is Hillary Clinton going to the bathroom. This is the issue. It's disgusting. I don't wanna talk about it. No, it's too disgusting. Don't say it. It's disgusting. This is a guy who wants to be President of the United States. He must have a very unusual relationship with women."

Thank you all, God bless you, and may God bless America."
,"Now, one of the reasons I like Ted Cruz so much is that he's not controversial. He shouldn't be controversial because what he's doing is right. It's common sense, it's good government, it's so many good things. He's now a very popular and important figure. So with that I would like to introduce a very special guy: Senator Ted Cruz."
,"Ever wonder how Hillary Clinton can afford so many ads? Chances are they were paid for with Wall Street cash. Hillary Clinton has gotten 54 times more money from Wall Street interests than from all of Iowa. Hillary rewarded Wall Street with a $700 Billion bailout. Then Wall Street made her a multi-millionaire. I represented Wall Street. Heh, you sure did Hillary. Does Iowa really want Wall Street in the White House?"
,"Do not be fooled. Any significant division within the Republican party leads to the same awful result. Hillary Rodham Clinton in January 2017 taking the oath of office as President of the United States. This country cannot afford that outcome and thus we Republicans have a duty, I believe a profound moral duty, to work together. I'm Chris Christie and I approve this message."
,"And I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. See when you're a senator what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk and talk so much that nobody ever keep up with what you're saying. I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. In Iowa now as you know Ted, in the last three polls I'm beating you. Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. And we don't need a weak person being President of the United States, ok because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb. No you already had your chance Marco, and you blew it. You used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it. I appreciate your dumping your oppo research folder on on the debate, no it's your record. At least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false. I would try to convince them otherwise but this last back and forth between two senators, backbench senators, it explains why we have the mess in Washington D.C. I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV."
,I'm Donald Trump and I approve this message. The politicians can pretend it's something else but Donald Trump calls it radical Islamic terrorism. That's why he's calling for a temporary shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until we can figure out what's going on. He'll quickly cut the head of ISIS and take their oil. And he'll stop illegal immigration by building a wall in our southern border that Mexico will pay for. We will make America great again.
,"This president, with all due respect, believes that America's leadership and presence in the world is not a force for good. America has led the world and it is a more peaceful world when we're engaged the right way. We do not have to be the world's policemen. We have to be the world's leader. We have to stand for the values of freedom. Who's going to take care of the Christians that are being eliminated in the Middle East? But for the United States, who? Who's going to stand up for the dissidents inside of Iran that are brutalized each and every day? But for the United States, who? Who's going to take care of Israel and support them - our greatest ally in the Middle East? But for the United States, no one - no one is capable of doing this. The United States has the capability of doing this, and it's in our economic and national security interest that we do it.

,"Just one other thing I gotta get this off my chest. Donald Trump is a jerk. Donald Trump facing new criticism for something he did on the campaign trail last night in South Carolina. He appeared to mock a reporter with a disability. You gotta see this guy. I don't know what I said. I don't remember. I have a 12 year old son who's handicapped, he has cerebral palsy, and that just made me so angry I told my wife I just couldn't let that stand. I had to do something. Make sure Donald Trump wasn't the nominee for the Republican Party. I believe life is precious. I think life is truly a gift from God, and we're all equal under God's watchful eye. That's what I believe and when anybody, anybody disparages people with disabilities it sets me off. That's why I called him a jerk. What kind of person would you wanna have in the presidency that does that? At what point do we say enough of this? Let's start solving problems."

,"Paris is once again in morning. This was terrorism at its worst. This is likely ISIS. Our leaders must keep America safe, but when Ted Cruz had the chance to fight Barack Obama's dangerously weak anti-terror policies, he didn't.

All nine of the people here would make an infinitely better commander-in-chief than Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton. But what Donald Trump was saying was nothing against Muslims. If it's Trump, so be it. That's who I'll support. We will build a wall that works and I'll get Donald Trump to pay for it. I'll build it. What the hell is going on?"

,"I'm Donald Trump and I approve this message. Sounded like you wanted the bill to pass. Of course I wanted the bill to pass, my amendment to pass. What my amendment did is take citizenship off the table but it doesn't mean what it what it doesn't mean that I supported the other aspects of the bill. I want immigration reform to pass and that allows those who are here illegally to come out of the shadows. That amendment would have allowed undocumented immigrants to remain in the US permanently and obtain legal status so how do you square that circle? Actually Brett it it wouldn't have.

,There are those who say we cannot defeat a corrupt political system and fix a rigged economy. But I believe we need to lift our vision above the obstacles in place and look to the American horizon. To a nation where every child cannot only dream of going to college but attend one. Where quality health care will be a birthright of every citizen. Where a good job is not a wish but a reality. Where women receive equal pay and a living wage is paid to all. An America where after a lifetime of labor there is time for rest and grandchildren. A nation that defends our people and our values but no longer carries so much of that burden alone. I know we can create that America if we listen to our hearts and that journey begins here in Iowa.

,"Imagine the greatest Christmas stories told by the senator who once read Green Eggs and Ham from the senate floor. Twas the night before the shutdown and all through the house not a bill was stirring not even to fund a mouse.

So we really want to thank Governor O'Malley for his plan and helping to lead the charge to expand AmeriCorps to 250,000 members. You know we're really excited and we were happy to hear more about his plan."
,Did you know that Washington is built on a swamp? Massive government debt? Stifling regulations? Special interest politics? Partisan dysfunction. Now it all makes sense. Washington is broken. The political class broke it. together we can drain the swamp and protect our children's future. I'm Ben Carson and I approve this message.
,"If you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. But the Republicans, they want to go back to letting the super wealthy call the shots. They don't stand up for equal pay for women. They don't support paid family leave. They don't even really support refinancing student debt. We've got to get this economy working for the vast majority of Americans, not just for those at the top. That's what I intend to do as President. I'm Hillary Clinton."

,"Hippo...Crit...one bellows, one bellows malarkey. Donald Trump repeatedly says one thing and does another. The hypocrite says he's a champion of American workers but had his line of Trump ties made in China. Some of the laborers on his palatial BC hotel -- illegal immigrants. Neither for president. America needs proven, honorable leadership. John Kasich. New Day for America is responsible for the content of this advertising."
,"ISIS has said all they want is what they call the sweet taste of American blood. We have a president who said I don't understand the anxiety that people feel about terrorism. Mrs. Clinton, who said that as to Isis, we're finally exactly where we want to be. When it's a failure she refuses to be accountable. After Paris at the San Bernardino. We need to do everything we need to do to protect this country. We need a president who knows how to protect the American people. That's the kind of president that I will be. There is nothing more important. America Leads is responsible for the content of this advertising."
,"My brother Brian Terry was murdered protecting our border. Brian died because of Obama's Fast and Furious scandal. For me, this is personal. This is about protecting America and everyone who fights for it. That's why I support Marco Rubio. From the border to the battlefield, I know Marco Rubio will give people like my brother the support they need. I'm voting for Marco. I hope you will too."
,"We all see what's happening. Jeb Bush is desperate and spending millions on false attacks. Don't fall for it. When I'm president, there will be no amnesty. I'll cancel Obama's unconstitutional executive orders; cut sanctuary city funding; and deport criminal aliens. We'll add 20,000 border agents; finish all 700 miles of border wall; and if we aren't 100 percent sure who you are and why you're coming to America, you're not getting in. I'm Marco Rubio. I approved this message to keep America safe."
,"I'm disappointed and I'm really offended. Personally, the particular comments of Mr. Huckabee would be considered ridiculous if it weren't so sad. And let there be no doubt Israel will know, as will the whole world, that we are their trusted friend and the ayatollahs of Iran will know that hell will freeze over before they get a nuclear weapon."
,I'm Donald Trump and I approve this message. The politicians can pretend it's something else but Donald Trump calls it radical Islamic terrorism. That's why he's calling for a temporary shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until we can figure out what's going on. He'll quickly cut the head of ISIS and take their oil. And he'll stop illegal immigration by building a wall in our southern border that Mexico will pay for. We will make America great again.
,"John Kasich is an impatient rascal. Faces, pushes. But unlike some his state is now booming unlike some. John Kasich has proven he can do the job. Brought bank jobs from Mexico and China. Keep us safe, make us boom, because he's done it before. Only an impatient rascal can bring America back. John Kasich. New Day for America is responsible for the content of this advertising."
